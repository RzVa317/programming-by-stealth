# The Replicator Module

A JavaScript Module providing a class representing a very basic replicator.

The class is easy to use:

```
import Replicator from './src/Replicator.class.mjs';
const myReplicator = new Replicator();
console.log(myReplicator.replicate('pancakes'));
```

This module was written as a demo for [Instalment 131](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs131) of the Programming by Stealth series by [Bart Busschots](https://bartb.ie/) & [Allison Sheridan](https://podfeet.com).
