## PBS 146 Challenge Solution

The challenge set at the end of [the previous instalment](./pbs146) was to:

> [Write] a script that accepts a a whole number as an input, either as the first argument or from a user prompt, then prints out the standard n-times multiplication tables to the screen.

There was also the stipulation to use the `bc` (*basic calculator*) terminal command to do the needed math. Finally, for optional extra credit, support could be added for a second argument to specify the maximum number the tables should go to.

You'll find my sample solution in this instalment's ZIP as `pbs146-challenge-solution.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# deal with the number to multiply
# start with the value of the first arg, if any
num="$1"

# make sure we have a valid value
until echo "$num" | egrep -q '^[1-9][0-9]*$'
do
    read -p 'Enter a positive whole number: ' num
done

# figure out how high to count to
max=10
if [[ ! -z "$2" ]] # if there is a second arg, validate it
then
    if echo "$2" | egrep -q '^[1-9][0-9]*$'
    then
        max=$2
    else
        echo 'invalid maximum value - must be a positive integer'
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# loop through the table
for n in $(seq $max)
do
    # do the math
    prod=$(echo "$n*$num" | bc)

    # print the line
    echo "$num x $n = $prod"
done
```

The majority of the code is unremarkable in that it just uses the basic programming primitives of variable assignments, conditionals, and loops. But, I do want to draw attention to a few subtleties.

Firstly, I'd never actually used the `bc` command myself before starting my sample solution, so when I set the challenge I didn't actually know how it worked either! I found the `man` page needlessly complicated, but searching for some examples online I quickly realised that the simplest was to use `bc` is to pipe an arithmetic expression to it as a string, e.g."

```bash
echo '1+1' | bc
``` 

So, I used this approach with variable substitution to do my math:

```bash
prod=$(echo "$n*$num" | bc)
```

Secondly, I made liberal use of a convenient regular expression trick to check for whole numbers greater than zero without using mathematical operators — I checked for the pattern *starts with one digit between 1 & 9, then zero or more digits between 0 & 9, and then ends*, i.e. the PCRE regular expression `^[1-9][0-9]*$`.

Finally, I want to draw your attention to the fact that this script is not written to take input in the same way terminal commands usually do. The normal approach would be for the optional maximum value to be a named parameter, e.g. `tables.sh 5 -m 11`. This thought serves as a little teaser for a very powerful bash utility we'll be learning about soon specifically designed to parse a list of arguments that includes flags and named parameters, `getopt`.

## Arrays (Lists)  in Bash

Under the hood in Bash a regular array, or a list,  is just an *associative array*, i.e. a dictionary, with numbers as the keys in the key-value pairs. I should also mention that in the official Bash documentation, the terms used are not *key* or *keys*, but *index* or *indices*, and you'll see those same terms used in many online tutorials too. Note that Bash arrays are zero-indexed, like we're used to from JavaScript.

Even though lists and dictionaries are the same deep down, Bash does offer some list-specific syntax details we need to learn about.

The most explicit way to create an empty array is with the `declare` command and the `-a` flag:

```bash
declare -a desertList
```

The above command creates a new variable named `desertList`.

We can append values onto the end of arrays with the `+=` operator, e.g.:

```bash
desertList+=waffles
```

We can also write to a specific array index using the `[]` syntax you're familiar with from JavaScript, e.g.:

```bash
desertList[1]=pancakes
```

To access specific elements of an array we use the `[]` syntax in conjunction with a braced version of the`$` syntax:

```bash
echo "${desertList[0]}"
```

We can use the special array index `@` to access the contents of the array as a list of arguments:

```bash
echo "${desertList[@]}"
```

This is extremely useful, because it allows us to use arrays as lists of arguments for commands, including to the `for` command:

```bash
for desert in echo ${desertList[@]}
do
  echo "* $desert"
done
```

While creating an empty array and adding values to it with `+=` is very common, you often know exactly what values you need when you are creating an array, so Bash lets you assign list of arguments directly to an array using the `()` syntax:

```bash
breakfastList=(porridge pop\ tarts 'French omelette')
```

Note that this is a list of arguments, so it is space-delimited, not `,` delimited like in many other languages. Also note that that means spaces in the values need to be escaped, or the values with spaces need to be quoted. So, the above example creates an array with three items, `'porridge'`, `'pop tarts'`, and `'French omelette'`

Finally, you can get the length of the array by combining the `$`, `[]` and `@` syntax we've already seen with the `#` syntax which we've not met yet:

```bash
echo "there are ${#breakfastList[@]} items in the breakfast list"
```
