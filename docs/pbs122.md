## Final Thoughts

To a large extent this instalment has been a bit of a tease — we know why we want to manage our dot files, that Chezmoi is a good tool for doing that job, we've examined Chezmoi's world view, and we've even initialised Chezmoi, but we haven't actually managed any files yet!

That's where we'll start next time — using Chezmoi to manage dot files on a single computer. Next we'll take things up a notch and add a remote Git repo and a second computer into the mix, and then we'll finish up by looking at how we can use templates to generate different target states for each computer from the same source state.
