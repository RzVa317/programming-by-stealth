## Managing Files with Chezmoi

If you have an existing file that you'd like Chezmoi to import into its source state, simply add it with the `chezmoi add` command. As an example, let's add our Git config and global ignore files:

```
chezmoi add ~/.gitconfig ~/.gitignore_global
```

We can now see that Chezmoi is managing these two files:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi managed
.gitconfig
.gitignore_global
bart-imac2018:~ bart%
```

## Peeking Under the Hood — the Chezmoi Source Folder

We mentioned last time that Chezmoi applies a naming convention to files when they are added to the source, we can use the `chezmoi source-path` command to see the actual path to the source versions of managed files.

For example, we can see the path to the source version of `~/.gitconfig` with:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi source-path ~/.gitconfig 
/Users/bart/.local/share/chezmoi/dot_gitconfig
bart-imac2018:~ bart% 
```

We can use the command to reveal the path to the source folder by running it without any arguments:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi source-path             
/Users/bart/.local/share/chezmoi
bart-imac2018:~ bart% 
```

We can use the Bash/Zsh shell's back-tick operator to use the output of the above command as the argument to the `cd` command to actually change into the Chezmoi source directory (the `pwd` command shows the current path):

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% pwd
/Users/bart
bart-imac2018:~ bart% cd `chezmoi source-path`
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% pwd
/Users/bart/.local/share/chezmoi
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart%
```

Now that we're in here we can have a proper look around with the `ls` command:

```
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  5 bart  staff  160  5 Aug 23:59 ./
drwxr-xr-x  3 bart  staff   96 23 Jul 10:03 ../
drwxr-xr-x  9 bart  staff  288  4 Aug 23:50 .git/
-rw-r--r--  1 bart  staff  431  5 Aug 23:59 dot_gitconfig
-rw-r--r--  1 bart  staff   10  5 Aug 23:59 dot_gitignore_global
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% 
```

Notice that we have our two re-named managed files, and a hidden `.git` folder, because Chezmoi initialises its source state as a git repo for us.

We chose to change into the Chezmoi folder using the `cd` command in conjunction with the `chezmoi source-path` command. There is a more direct route to almost the same outcome, but with one subtle difference.

The `chezmoi cd` command opens a new shell and changes to the source directory inside that shell:

```
chezmoi cd
```

At first glance nothing has changed, but you are now in a shell within a shell. The most obvious difference is that you have lost your history, hitting the up arrow will not show `chezmoi cd` like you would expect. You can also prove you are in a new shell by leaving it with the `exit` command. If you exit in your terminal windows's primary shell you'll be told the process has completed and be left with an unusable window, but if you're in a shell within a shell you'll simply return to the outer shell.

You can also prove you are in a new shell by showing the current process ID before and after the `chezmoi cd` and `exit` commands. Bash and Zsh use the environment variable named `$` to store the process ID. you access an environment variable by pre-fixing its name with the `$` symbol, so you access the process ID with `$$`. The easiest way to see the value of an environment variable is with the `echo` command, so to see your current process ID you can use `echo $$`. The following sequence proves `chezmoi cd` starts an entire new shell rather than just changing the directory of the current shell:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% echo $$   
61420
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi cd
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% echo $$
66669
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% exit
bart-imac2018:~ bart% echo $$   
61420
bart-imac2018:~ bart%
```
 
 I'm not really sure why Chezmoi's developer chose to do it this way, but he did, so I think it's important to explain why your terminal might behave differently to how you expect after using the `chezmoi cd` command.
 
## Managing the Chezmoi Git Repo

## Final Thoughts

To a large extent this instalment has been a bit of a tease — we know why we want to manage our dot files, that Chezmoi is a good tool for doing that job, we've examined Chezmoi's world view, and we've even initialised Chezmoi, but we haven't actually managed any files yet!

That's where we'll start next time — using Chezmoi to manage dot files on a single computer. Next we'll take things up a notch and add a remote Git repo and a second computer into the mix, and then we'll finish up by looking at how we can use templates to generate different target states for each computer from the same source state.
