# PBS 123 of X ‚Äî Backing up and Syncing Dot Files with Chezmoi

In [the previous instalment](./pbs122) we learned how to use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to do basic *dot file* management. We learned how to add targets to Chezmoi's source state, to edit targets in the source state, to apply the source state to the destination directory, and finally, to remove targets from the source state and optionally also the target directory. We also learned how to use the Git repo Chezmoi creates for us to version our dot files, and how to add a configuration file to tweak Chezmoi's behaviour. In short ‚Äî we learned the Chezmoi basics.

Versioning your dot files on a single computer is valuable ‚Äî it gives you a *get out of jail free* card should you mess up, but obviously there's more value in getting your dot files into the cloud at the very least, if not also synchronising your dot files across computers.

We'll start this instalment by leveraging Chezmoi's use of Git to back our dot files up to the cloud, but then we'll take what might seem like a strange turn ‚Äî we'll explore Chezmoi's support for templates. Why? Because templates are critically important to getting your Git files to work well across multiple machines.

TO DO

## Backing Your Dot Files Up to the Cloud

There's no one way to get a Git repo from your local machine into the cloud, and at the end of the day, what ever works, works, but in my experience the following is the path of least resistance:

1. Create **empty** (uninitialised) **private** repo in the cloud
2. Add empty cloud repo to the local repo as a remote named `origin`
3. Push and track the current local branch

To get a good backup you don't have to use a hosted cloud service, you could use another computer on your home network, or a NAS of some kind, but the simplest option is probably a private repo on GitHub. That's what I'll be doing in this worked example.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create a Private Repo in the Cloud

Again, you could use any remote Git repo, I', just using GitHub because it's free and easy.

Create a new repository in GitHub. Give it a name and description that make sense to you, then be sure to select *Private* rather than the default of *Public*, and finally, be sure **not** to check **any** of the boxes in the *Initialise this repository with* section.

INSERT SCREENSHOT 1

Once the repository is created you'll be presented with a screen showing various options for getting content into the empty repository. All we want from this screen is the repo's URL, for SSH if you have keys set up, or for HTTPS if you don't.

INSERT SCREENSHOT 2

Armed with your repo's URL, open a Terminal and enter your Chezmoi source directory with the `chezmoi cd` command.

Remember that your Chezmoi source directory is a Git repo, so you can now use the regular Git commands to add your new repo as a remote named `origin`. Once the remote has been added, you want to push the current local branch to `origin` and set it up to track.

As an example, here's the entire process on my Mac:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi cd
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% git remote add origin git@github.com:bartificer/pbs-dotfiles-demo.git
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% git push -u origin master

Counting objects: 100% (13/13), done.

Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Writing objects: 100% (13/13), 1.34 KiB | 1.34 MiB/s, done.
Total 13 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.
To github.com:bartificer/pbs-dotfiles-demo.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart%
```

Depending on your version of Git, your Chezmoi repo may have been created with `main` rather than `master`, you can check your branch name with `git status`.

That's all there is to it, you can now push all your changes as you would with any other repo.

### Automatically Pushing

In the previous instalment we learned that we could configure Chezmoi to automatically add new files to Git, and optionally automatically commit them too. Well, there is a third option, you can automatically push the automatic commits by setting the config variable `git.autoPush` to `true`. Just like `git.autoCommit` implies `git.autoAdd`, `git.autoPush` implies `git.autoCommit` which implies `git.autoAdd`.

Since I like to name and manage my own commits, I don't enable this setting.

## Templating Refresher

It's been a while since we used templates in this series, so it's worth taking a moment to remind ourselves of the basic concept. A templating engine takes template text containing some kind of placeholders and some data as input, and combines them to produce output text. So far in this series we've used just one templating engine ‚Äî the JavaScript implementation of Moustache, but that's just one option of many.

## Templates in Chezmoi

The people behind Chezmoi very wisely chose not to invent their own templating language, but unfortunately for us, they didn't choose to use Moustache üôÅ Given that Chezmoi is written in the [Go language](https://golang.org), it's probably not surprising that they chose to use Go's [text/template package](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

The syntax is a little bit different to Moustache, but it's not more difficult. Unfortunately, the official documentation is not particularly human-friendly ‚Äî it has all the information you could possibly need, but the intended audience is Go programmers using text/template directly, not sysadmins using it indirectly through a third-party tool like Chezmoi. But don't worry, we'll cover the basics later in this instalment.

## Template Data in Chezmoi

The template text will be the contents of our dot files in the source state, and the outputs of our templates will be the contents of our dot files in the destination directory, but where does our data come from? Chezmoi gives us some sensible data out-of-the-box, and we get to define any additional data we'd like to have available.

### Chezmoi's Standard Data

You can see the data Chezmoi makes available in JSON format with the `chezmoi data` command. Here's the output on the Mac I'm writing these show  notes on:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi data
{
  "chezmoi": {
    "arch": "amd64",
    "fqdnHostname": "",
    "group": "staff",
    "homeDir": "/Users/bart",
    "hostname": "bart-imac2018",
    "kernel": {},
    "os": "darwin",
    "osRelease": {},
    "sourceDir": "/Users/bart/.local/share/chezmoi",
    "username": "bart",
    "version": {
      "builtBy": "Homebrew",
      "commit": "a3fb755a88315bbdecedba3d849324752989400d",
      "date": "2021-07-14T19:42:34Z",
      "version": "2.1.2"
    }
  }
}
bart-imac2018:~ bart% 
```

### Adding Your Own Data

You have two choices for how to add your own data, and you can mix-and-match if you like.

The first place you can add data is in the Chezmoi config file ‚Äî simple create a key named `data` and add any data you like in there.

As an example, here's my current config with a data section added:

```json
{
  "edit": {
    "command": "/usr/bin/open",
    "args": ["-a", "/Applications/Smultron.app", "-F", "-n", "-W"]
  },
  "git": {
    "autoAdd": true
  },
  "data": {
  	"name": "Bart Busschots",
  	"url": {
  		"personal": "https://bartb.ie/",
  		"podcasting": "https://lets-talk.ie/",
  		"consulting": "https://bartificer.net/"
  	}
  }
}
```

Note that once you save your config file with a data section in it, that data will also appear in the output of the `chezmoi data`:

```
bart-imac2018:~ bart% chezmoi data       
{
  "chezmoi": {
    "arch": "amd64",
    "fqdnHostname": "",
    "group": "staff",
    "homeDir": "/Users/bart",
    "hostname": "bart-imac2018",
    "kernel": {},
    "os": "darwin",
    "osRelease": {},
    "sourceDir": "/Users/bart/.local/share/chezmoi",
    "username": "bart",
    "version": {
      "builtBy": "Homebrew",
      "commit": "a3fb755a88315bbdecedba3d849324752989400d",
      "date": "2021-07-14T19:42:34Z",
      "version": "2.1.2"
    }
  },
  "name": "Bart Busschots",
  "url": {
    "consulting": "https://bartificer.net/",
    "personal": "https://bartb.ie/",
    "podcasting": "https://lets-talk.ie/"
  }
}
bart-imac2018:~ bart% 
```

As well as defining your own data in the config file, you can also add data via a special file in the source directory. Like Chezmoi's config file, the data file can be in any of the formats Chezmoi supports, but the extension must match the format of the file's contents. Regardless of the format, the data file's base name must be `.chezmoidata`. Since we'll be using JSON, our file must be named `.chezmoidata.json`.

Note that while this file is in the source directory, it's not in the source state, so we can't edit it with the `chezmoi edit` command. Instead, you need to use your own text editor of choice. Remember that the `chezmoi source-path` command will show you the location of you source directory, and `chezmoi cd` will open a new shell in your source directory.

An an example I added the following simple data file:

```json
{
  "socialMedia": {
    "flickr:": "bbusschots",
    "twitter": "bbusschots"
  }
}
```

And again, once this file is saved, its contents will become visible via the `chezmo data` command.

```
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% chezmoi data        
{
  "chezmoi": {
    "arch": "amd64",
    "fqdnHostname": "",
    "group": "staff",
    "homeDir": "/Users/bart",
    "hostname": "bart-imac2018",
    "kernel": {},
    "os": "darwin",
    "osRelease": {},
    "sourceDir": "/Users/bart/.local/share/chezmoi",
    "username": "bart",
    "version": {
      "builtBy": "Homebrew",
      "commit": "a3fb755a88315bbdecedba3d849324752989400d",
      "date": "2021-07-14T19:42:34Z",
      "version": "2.1.2"
    }
  },
  "name": "Bart Busschots",
  "socialMedia": {
    "flickr:": "bbusschots",
    "twitter": "bbusschots"
  },
  "url": {
    "consulting": "https://bartificer.net/",
    "personal": "https://bartb.ie/",
    "podcasting": "https://lets-talk.ie/"
  }
}
bart-imac2018:chezmoi bart% 
```
