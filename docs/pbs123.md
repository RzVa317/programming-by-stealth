# PBS 123 of X — Backing up and Syncing Dot Files with Chezmoi

In [the previous instalment](./pbs122) we learned how to use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to do basic *dot file* management. We learned how to add targets to Chezmoi's source state, to edit targets in the source state, to apply the source state to the destination folder, and finally, to remove targets from the source state and optionally also the target directory. We also learned how to use the Git repo Chezmoi created for us to version our dot files, and how to add a configuration file to tweak Chezmoi's behaviour. In short — we learned the Chezmoi basics.

Versioning your dot files on a single computer is valuable — it gives you a *get out of jail free* card should you mess up, but obviously there is more value in getting your dot files into the cloud at the very least, if not also synchronising your dot files across computers.

In this instalment we'll leverage Chezmoi's use of Git to first back our dot files up to the cloud, and then, sync them between multiple computers.
