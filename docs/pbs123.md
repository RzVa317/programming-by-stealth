# PBS 123 of X ‚Äî Backing up and Syncing Dot Files with Chezmoi

In [the previous instalment](./pbs122) we learned how to use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to do basic *dot file* management. We learned how to add targets to Chezmoi's source state, to edit targets in the source state, to apply the source state to the destination directory, and finally, to remove targets from the source state and optionally also the target directory. We also learned how to use the Git repo Chezmoi creates for us to version our dot files, and how to add a configuration file to tweak Chezmoi's behaviour. In short ‚Äî we learned the Chezmoi basics.

Versioning your dot files on a single computer is valuable ‚Äî it gives you a *get out of jail free* card should you mess up, but obviously there's more value in getting your dot files into the cloud at the very least, if not also synchronising your dot files across computers.

We'll start this instalment by leveraging Chezmoi's use of Git to back our dot files up to the cloud, but then we'll take what might seem like a strange turn ‚Äî we'll explore Chezmoi's support for templates. Why? Because templates are critically important to getting your Git files to work well across multiple machines.

## Templating Refresher

It's been a while since we used templates in this series, so it's worth taking a moment to remind ourselves of the basic concept. A templating engine takes template text containing some kind of placeholders and some data as input, and combines them to produce output text. So far in this series we've used just one templating engine ‚Äî the JavaScript implementation of Moustache, but that's just one option of many.

## Templates in Chezmoi

The people behind Chezmoi very wisely chose not to invent their own templating language, but unfortunately for us, they didn't choose to use Moustache üôÅ Given that Chezmoi is written in the [Go language](https://golang.org), it's probably not surprising that they chose to use Go's [text/template package](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

The syntax is a little bit different to Moustache, but it's not more difficult. Unfortunately, the official documentation is not particularly human-friendly ‚Äî it has all the information you could possibly need, but the intended audience is Go programmers using text/template directly, not sysadmins using it indirectly through a third-party tool like Chezmoi. But don't worry, we'll cover the basics later in this instalment.
