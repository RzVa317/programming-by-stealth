# PBS 136 of X — More Jesting

We met [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), the testing toolkit we'll be using for the JavaScript port of the Crypt::HSXKPasswd Perl module in the previous instalment. While we did use Jest, we only scratched the surface of what Jest can do. In this instalment we're not going to expand our knowledge so we have enough to get started on our project. This will not be anywhere near everything there is to know about Jest, but it will be enough for us for now.

## A Quick Jest Refresher

In the previous instalment we learned that in Jest we use the `test()` function to define tests, and each of those tests contains one or more expectations, which we implement with the `expect()` function.

As a reminder of the syntax, here's an overly simplistic example:

```js
 test('JavaScript can add', ()=>{
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
 });
```
