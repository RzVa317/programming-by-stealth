# PBS 132 of X â€” Managing JSDoc

We started our short journey into the world of documentation in instalment 130 by exploring the more philosophical side of documentation â€” why it's a good idea in general, why we need it for our project, who our audiences are, and what documentation we need. I also explained why I think JSDoc is a good fit for us, and set the big-picture scene. We will use JSDoc comments to embed our API documentation into our source code, we'll add some additional static content, and there will be two versions of our documentation, one for developers using the API, and one for contributors helping to write the API itself.

With that foundation laid, we spend the previous instalment learning about those JSDoc comments we'll be embedding in our source code. Now, in this instalment, we'll look at the practicalities of managing our documentation within the project, how we can add a lot of very useful automation, and we'll look at how we can customise the look of the generated documentation with a JSDoc theme.

## Configuring JSDoc (with a Config File)

In the previous instalment we got a glimpse of how to use a JSDoc configuration file, but it deserves a deeper look.

JSDoc's configuration is ultimately a simple JavaScript object (dictionary), but there are two ways to define it â€” directly as as JSON file, or indirectly as a CommonJS (not ES6) JavaScript module that exports it. Writing code to generate the config is overkill for most people most of the time, and since we've not learned about CommonJS modules (opting for the standard ES6 format instead), we'll be using a JSON file.

JSDoc's config file support is asymmetric â€” anything you can do on the command line you can do via a config file, but there are things you can do  via a config file that you can't do on the command line.

This asymmetry is the reason we use a config file last week even though I'd have preferred not to. The config setting `source.includePattern` doesn't have a command line equivalent, so we needed to use a config file to get JSDoc to process `.mjs` files at all, hence, for our purposes, the most basic possible config file is:

```json
{
	"source": {
        "includePattern": ".+\\.(mjs|jsdoc)$"
    }
}
```

### Specifying the Source

Up to this point we've been specifying the source files as arguments on the command line, but we can avoid that by specifying one or more folders to load from using `source.include` which should be an array of file paths. Let's add the `src` folder:

```json
{
	"source": {
		"include": ["./src/"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.(mjs|jsdoc)$"
    }
}
```

By default JSDoc will recurse 10 levels deep into the included folders, but you can control it with the `recurseDepth` option, or disable it altogether by setting `opts.recurse` to `false`.

### Replacing Command Line Flags (Readme & Encoding)

Speaking of the `opts` dictionary, that's an import one â€” every command line flag can be controlled using it's long name as a sub-key of `opts`, e.g. the `-R` flag's long name is `--readme`, so we can include our `README.md` by setting `opts.readme`:

```json
{
    "opts": {
        "readme": "README.md"
    },
    "source": {
        "include": ["./src/"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.(mjs|jsdoc)$"
    }
}
```

What happens if the config file specifies one value for a flag, and the command line another? The command line wins, or, in the formal jargon â€” **command line arguments take precedence over config file keys**.

You might imagine we should set the destination folder in the config file too. The flag is `--destination`, so it could indeed be set with `opts.destination`, but there are two reason we don't want to do this:

1. There is no one output dir for us, we will be generating two sets of documentation for our two audiences after all.
2. As part of our automation of the process we'll need to empty this folder, so to avoid having to change the value in two places, we should specify it in the automation only.

However there is one more option we should set while we're editing this section of the config. It's good practice to be specific about character encodings, so let's use the `--encoding` flag to specify UTF8:

```json
{
    "opts": {
        "encoding": "utf8",
        "readme": "./README.md"
    },
    "source": {
        "include": ["./src/"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.(mjs|jsdoc)$"
    }
}
```

You'll find the [full list of command line flags in the documentation](https://jsdoc.app/about-commandline.html).

### Enabling Plugins

There are no command line flags for controlling plugins, so the only way to enable them is by adding them to the `plugins` array. The only plugin we need is the built-in Markdown one, so let's add that:

```jsdoc
{
    "opts": {
        "encoding": "utf8",
        "readme": "./README.md"
    },
    "source": {
        "include": ["./src/"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.(mjs|jsdoc)$"
    }, 
    "plugins": [
        "plugins/markdown"
    ]
}
```

We'll be using the Markdown plugin in its default configuration, but there are a few tweaks you can make, and they're described on the [Markdown page of the documentation](https://jsdoc.app/plugins-markdown.html).

## Automating The Document Genetation (NPM Scripts)

A JSDoc config file can simplify our `jsdoc` command significantly, but there's still too much to remember, so we need to automate the process. We can use NPM's scripts feature to do this for us.

NodeJS project files (`package.json`) support a key named `scripts` that's a dictionary of terminal commands indexed by human-friendly names. You then run the named terminal commands with `npm run`.

The `npm init` command pre-populates `scripts` with a default placeholder command named `test`, we'll add our commands above that.

Let's start with a simple script to generate out docs:

```json
"scripts": {
    "docs": "npx jsdoc -c ./jsdoc.conf.json --destination ./docs",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

One we save `package.json` we could generate out docs with the command `npm run docs`.

However, this initial implementation is too naive. While JSDoc will create a folder if one does not already exist, it won't empty one that does, so we need to take care of that. If we're prepared to tolerate some error messages we could naively pre-fix our command with the `rm` command to delete the contents of our output folder:

```json
"scripts": {
    "docs": "rm -rf ./docs/*; npx jsdoc -c ./jsdoc.conf.json --destination ./docs",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

The first time we try to generate our documentation the folder won't exist, so we'll see an error from the `rm` command, but the docs will still generate. Many people would find this tolerable, but TBH, I don't, so we can do better ðŸ™‚

The Posix `test` command has an alias named `[[` which allows simple tests to be written as `[[ CONDITION ]] && COMMAND` where the command will only execute if the condition is met. The `-e` condition checks for *existence*, so `[[ -e ./docs ]] && rm -rf ./docs/*` will do nothing if there is no `docs` folder, and empty it if there is.

At this stage the same string `./docs` appears in three places in our command, how easy would it be to forget to update it in one of those three places if we were ever to want to change the name? Too easy!

The solution for that is a shell variable which I'll named `docDir`. On a POSIX shell, a variable is defined with its name immediately followed by an `=` immediately followed by a value â€” **no spaces**! A variable can be included in a double-quoted string with its name pre-fixed with a dollar sign, so we can define `docDir` with the command `docDir='./docs'`, and then use it in an `rm` command like so: `rm -rf "$docDir/"*`. Putting all that together with the test command we get the following raw Bash command:

```bash
docDir='./docs'; [[ -e "$docDir" ]] && rm -rf "$docDir/"*; npx jsdoc -c ./jsdoc.conf.json --destination "$docDir/"
```

Notice that the raw Bash command contains quotation marks, that means we need to escape those as `\"`when adding them into JSON, so that command becomes the following snippet in `package.json`:

```json
 "scripts": {
    "docs": "docDir='./docs'; [[ -e \"$docDir\" ]] && rm -rf \"$docDir/\"*; npx jsdoc -c ./jsdoc.conf.json --destination \"$docDir/\"",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

### Example 1 â€” Auto-Generated Docs

In the instalment ZIP file you'll find a folder named `pbs132a`, this is a NodeJS project folder containing our example code from last week, our updated `jsdoc.conf.json`, and a `package.json` file that defines out `scripts.docs` command.

Change into this folder in the terminal, then install the NodeJS dependencies with:

```
npm ci
```

Now generate the docs with:

```
npm run docs
```
