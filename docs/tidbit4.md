# PBS Tibit 4 of Y — Re-thinking a Web App – from Web Server to Cloud Stack

In the main PBS series we're hovering on the edge of moving from purely client-side JavaScript apps to full web apps with a client and *'server'* side, but as we approach that word *server* is becoming every more abstract. At this stage it really does just mean *"something on the other side of an HTTPS connection"* - the days of web servers just being remote computers are well and truly over.

I've been thinking about this a lot because I've just finished helping Allison migrate her website from the old-world single-server model, not a modern cloud architecture, and boosting her site's performance by a few hundred percent in the processes (no exaggeration ).

From the point of view of a visitor www.podfeet.com is a website, but from Allison's point of view it really is a web app. It's not a collection of HTML pages, but an advanced web app that manages a well structured data set, provides a web based interface for editing content, an API for integrating with 3rd-party clients, and presents customised views of the data to visitors as HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
