# PBS 138 of X — Bundling a Web App with Webpack

In the previous instalment we looked at how to use Webpack to bundle a JavaScript library for sharing with the world. This is the Webpack use-case we'll need for the JavaScript port of the `Crypt::HSXKPasswd` Perl module. I'd originally intended to leave the other Webpack use-case, bundling a web app or web site, until later in the series, when we would be re-writing the http://www.xkpasswd.net web app to use our new JavaScript implementation of the password generation module. But, based on the questions I'm being asked, and the personal projects people in the PBS community are working on, I've decided to move the topic forward, so let's go!

## Why do we need to Bundle Web Apps/Sites?

Up until this point in the series we have imported our dependencies into our web apps using CDNs (content delivery networks) by simply adding appropriate tags into our HTML markup. This has the advantage is being both simple to do and simple to understand — just add the tag, and the browser fetches the latest version from the given URL.

What's wrong with this simple approach?

1. **Version management is difficult** — if we embed a URL for the latest version then we will automatically get upgraded, but we'll have no control over the timing, so our app could just break at any moment. If we embed the URL for a specific version we have to manually check each dependency for new URLs which is cumbersome, so unlikely to happen.
2. **We can't work off-line** — you need an internet connection to load resources from CDNs, so if we go that route we can't work in our code from places without internet access. Those are getting fewer and further between, but still, it would be nice to keep our work self-contained.

## Managing Dependencies with NPM

There are NodeJS packages for all the 3rd-party libraries we've used in this series, so we can use NPM to download copies into our projects and manage their versioning. We can use `npm install` to install the packages we need, `npm outdated` to check for available updates, and `npm upgrade` to apply them.

Once you run `npm install` or `npm ci` all the dependencies will be downloaded, so you won't need network connectivity again until you want to update the dependencies you have, or add more.

At this point the dependencies will be installed in your `node_modules` folder. You could update your HTML to reference the new file paths in `node_modules` with relative URLs, but then to publish your site you'd need to publish your `node_modules` folder to your web server, which is inefficient at best.

## Bundling the Dependencies with Webpack

Similarly to how we converted source code in one folder (`/src`) to bundled code in another (`/dist`) when bundling a library in the previous instalment, we need to write our HTML, CSS & JavaScript in a source folder, and then build bundled versions of the CSS & JavaScript with WebPack, and update our HTML to use the bundle(s).

Once everything is configured the process would be:

1. Edit the code in the source folder (we'll be using `/src`)
2. Build the code using Webpack (we'll configure it to work with `npm run build`)
3. Run the code from the destination folder (we'll be using `/docs` for GitHub Pages compatibility)

To get this to work there are some pre-requisites:

1. Your `package.json` file must specify an entry point by setting the value of the `main` key to the path of your primary JavaScript file, we will be using `src/index.js`.
2. Your entry point must directly or indirectly (by including a file that imports ...) import all your JavaScript & CSS dependencies.
3. You must have Webpack and its needed plugins installed as dev dependencies (`npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli css-loader style-loader copy-webpack-plugin`)
4. You need a basic `webpack.config.js` that specifies the entry point, output folder, copies the HTML file(s), and maps CSS files to the appropriate loaders — TO DO — add example
5. Your HTML file(s) need to use relative URLs to import the bundles
6. You need to configure an NPM script named `build` that invokes `webpack` using `npx` — TO DO — add example

## A Worked Example

That sounds more complicated than it is, so it's see how it really works with a somewhat contrived example that uses a good variety of the third-party libraries we've made use of in this series — Bootstrap, jQuery TO DO — update list

You'll find the final working code in the `pbs138a` folder in this instalment's ZIP file, to see the working code in action, open that folder in. terminal and run:

```sh
npm ci; npm run build
```

Running those commands will install the needed NodeJS packages and then run WebPack to generate the final page in the newly created `docs/` folder. Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to view the bundled page.

On the other hand, if you'd like to play along and work through the example you'll just need an empty folder and a terminal window open in that folder.

### Step 1 — Initialise an ES6 Node Package

The first step is to initialise NodeJS with `npm init`. You can answer what ever you like for most questions, but be sure to set the entry point to `src/index.js`. This will create a `package.json` file for you and hence initialise the folder as a regular NodeJS package. We now need to tell it we'd like to work in ES6 mode. We do that by editing `package.json` to add the top-level key named `type` with the value `"module"`. Your final `package.json` should look something like the following, bearing in mind that the only two keys you must have identical to mine are `type` and `main` (the entry point):

```json
{
  "name": "pbs138a",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An example project for instalment 138 of the Programming by Stealth series.",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Bart Busschots",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

### Step 2 — Create a Basic Page with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

To get our example started, let's create a simple HTML page (`src/index.html`) that reads some CSS from an external file (`src/index.css`), and some JavaScript from an external file (`src/index.js`). You'll find copies of all three files in the folder `pbs138a-1` in the instalment ZIP. Be sure to create an `src` folder and copy the three files in there.

These files are very basic, they are purely intended to show that the page contains working CSS & JavaScript loaded from external files. Let's look at `index.html` first:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>PBS 138 — Webpack Demo</title>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css" type="text/css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello <span id="world-modifier">Static</span> World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is simply an HTML 5 document that loads a single JavaScript file from `./index.js`, and a single CSS file from `./index.css`, and displays a single header that says *Hello Static World!*. The word *Static* is contained in a `<span>` tag with the ID `world-modifier`.

The CSS in `index.css` simply colours anything with the ID `world-modifier` purple:

```css
#world-modifier{
    color: purple;
}
```

And finally, `index.js` simply defines a plain JavaScript (no jQuery) document ready handler that finds anything with the ID `world-modifier` and replaces its contents with the string `'Dynamic'`:

```js
// a document ready handler in plain JavaScript (no JQuery)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    document.getElementById('world-modifier').innerText = 'Dynamic';
}, false);
```

If you open `index.html` in your browser you can verify that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are working if the heading you see is `Hello Dynamic World!` (that means the JavaScript changed it successfully), and the word *Dynamic* is in purple.

### Step 3 — Install and Configure Webpack

We need to install both the core Webpack packages, and the loaders and plugins we'll need to transform our simple web page:

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli css-loader style-loader copy-webpack-plugin
```

Next we need to create a simple Webpack config that will copy our HTML file and bundle our JS and CSS files:

```js
// Needed hackery to get __filename and __dirname in ES6 mode
// see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46745014/alternative-for-dirname-in-node-js-when-using-es6-modules
import path from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// import the Webpack copy plugin
import CopyPlugin from 'copy-webpack-plugin';

// export the Webpack config
export default {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'docs'),
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    'style-loader',
                    'css-loader'
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new CopyPlugin({
            patterns: [
                { from: "src/index.html", to: "index.html" }
            ],
        })
    ]
};
```

The first seven lines are simply copied-and-pasted from the previous instalment — they are workarounds for some foibles with NodeJS's current (summer 2022) ES6 implementation.

The first thing we see in this config that we've not seen before is the import statement for the Webpack copy plugin. This plugin gives us the ability to copy files from our source folder to our output folder un-changed. We use that plugin in the `plugins` section of the config to copy our HTML file from `src/index.html` to `index.html` in the configured output folder (`docs`).

The main body of our config starts by setting the entry point to our JavaScript file. This is because Webpack is first and foremost a JavaScript bundler, so it works best when you give it a JavaScript file as its starting point.

Next we override the default output settings by specifying `docs` as the output folder rather than `dist`, and `bundle.js` as the file name for the generated bundle rather than `main.js`.

Again, because Webpack is primarily a JavaScript bundler, it bundles JavaScript by default, so no config is needed to tell it to do that. However, we want to do more than just bundle JavaScript, we also want to bundle CSS. The key to understanding how this is works is to remember that we can use JavaScript to alter a page's style (we've done this using jQuery, but it can be done with plain JavaScript too). What Webpack can do, with the help of some additional modules, is translate CSS into JavaScript code that achieves the same outcome, and then include that generated CSS code in the bundle it generates (`bundle.js`).

To bundle CSS we need to tell Webpack while file extensions to treat as CSS, and which additional modules we'd like it to use to process the CSS for us. This is done by adding a `rule` to the `module` definition for the generated bundle. We need the rule to apply to all files that end in `.css`, and we want those files to be processed by two loaders — `css-loader` which can read CSS files via an ES6 `import` statement, and `style-loader` which can generate JavaScript to inject styles into the DOM. Putting it all together we get the following rule, the `test` key is where we specify the file patter, and the `use` key is where we list the loaders to use for all matching imports:

```js
{
    test: /\.css$/,
    use: [
        'style-loader',
        'css-loader'
    ]
}
```

Before we can start to use our new config we need to add a build script into our NPM config by adding a new key named `build` to the `scripts` array in `package.json` with the value `npx webpack --mode=production` (as explained in the previous instalment). Your `package.json` file should now look something like:

```json
{
  "name": "pbs138a",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An example project for instalment 138 of the Programming by Stealth series.",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx webpack --mode=production",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Bart Busschots",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "copy-webpack-plugin": "^11.0.0",
    "css-loader": "^6.7.1",
    "style-loader": "^3.3.1",
    "webpack": "^5.74.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.10.0"
  }
}
```

The two changes from before are the dev dependencies added by the `npm install --save-dev` command, and the build script.

We can now test our build process by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

When you do this, a new folder named `docs` will be created, and it will contain two files, `index.html`, and `bundle.js`. So far so good! But, if you open `docs/index.html` in your browser you'll notice that neither the CSS nor JavaScript are loading because the greeting says *Hello Static World!*, and there's no purple 🙁

![The broken web app after initial bundling](assets/pbs138/screenshot-2-broken-noJS-noCSS.png)

Don't Panic!

We need to make two small changes to `index.html`:

1. We need to remove the `<link>` tag completely, our CSS is being bundled into our JavaScript bundle by the loaders we configured, so there's no need for a separate import any more.
2. We need to update the `<script>` tag to import the generated bundle.

You'll find an updated version of the file in the `pbs138a-2/src` folder in the instalment ZIP, but the HTML `head` now looks like this:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>PBS 138 — Webpack Demo</title>
  <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
</head>
```

If we now re-run our build script (`npm run build`), we'll see that our file now half-works again — the JavaScript is running because the greeting is back to the correct *Hello Dynamic World!*, but the CSS is not working because there's still no purple:

![The partially fixed web app after updating the HTML](assets/pbs138/screenshot-3-broken-JS-noCSS.png)

Again, don't panic!

Remember that Webpack figures out what to bundle by starting in the entry point (`src/index.js` in our case), and then following all `import` statements to build out the dependency tree to be bundled. Also remember that `css-loader` gives Webpack the ability to load CSS via `import` statements. As odd as it may sound, we need to update our JavaScript file to import our CSS! We do this by simply adding an import statement for `index.css` in `index.js`:

```javascript
import './index.css';
```

You'll find the updated `index.js` in the `pbs138a-2/src` folder in the instalment ZIP.

Now we can run our build command again (`npm run build`) and refresh the browser to see our fully working page 😀

### Step 4 — Import jQuery

OK, so far we've simply translated our own code from one form into another. There's no real advantage to doing that, and it's added extra complexity to our processes. We are of course complicating our workflow so we can enable better management of 3rd-party dependencies, so let's actually do that!

As a first example, let's add jQuery into our little project.

We'll use NPM to install a copy of jQuery into our project that we'll then build into our bundle. That means the copy of jQuery installed by NPM will only be needed to build our code, not to run it, so, it is actually a dev dependency, not a true dependency. The same logic will apply to other third-party libraries, so we'll be using `npm install --save-dev` to install the third party modules.

Let's install jQuery as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev jquery
```

To start using jQuery we now simply import it into our JS file using an ES 6 import:

```js
// import jQuery
import $ from 'jquery';
```

We can now replace our plain JS document ready handler with a much shorter and easier to read jQuery one:

```js
// a jQuery document ready handler
$(()=>{
    $('#world-modifier').text('jQuery');
});
```

So we can easily verify that the new handler is working, I've change the inserted word from *Dynamic* to *jQuery*. We can now build our updated page with `npm run build`, and when we refresh we can see that jQuery is indeed bundled in and doing its thing:

![The jQuery version of the web app](assets/pbs138/screenshot-5-withJQuery.png)

You'll find the full updated JavaScript file in the `pbs138a-3/src` folder in the instalment ZIP.

### Step 5 — Import Bootstrap

Next, let's import the other big library we've been using throughout this series, Bootstrap.

Again, we'll be bundling it into our app, so we install it as a dev dependency:

```js
npm install --save-dev bootstrap
```

Let's start with just the basics, the Bootstrap CSS without the optional JavaScript bells and whistles. We do this by importing the minified version of the Bootstrap CSS from within the installed package from within our JavaScript file:

```js
// import bootstrap CSS
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

Once we re-build our app with `npm run build` we can immediately see that the Bootstrap CSS has been imported because its more pleasant default typography has been applied:

![The app with the basic Bootstrap styling applied](assets/pbs138/screenshot-6-withBasicBootstrap.png)

Before we go on, Bootstrap's styles expect to be used within a container of some kind, so let's update the HTML to wrap things in a containing tag with some basic Bootstrap classes:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>PBS 138 — Webpack Demo</title>
    <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container p-3">
      <h1>Hello <span id="world-modifier">Static</span> World!</h1>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, let's go ahead and add a dismissible alert that says when the page was loaded. To make our lives a little easier, let's install and import Luxon, the successor to the venerable Moment.js time and date library:

```sh
npm install --save-dev luxon
```

And import it into our JavaScript file:

```js
// import Luxon
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
```

We can then update our event handler to inject a dismissible Bootstrap alert into the end of our container like so:

```js
// a jQuery document ready handler
$(()=>{
    // update the greeting to show jQuery ran
    $('#world-modifier').text('jQuery');

    // build and add an alert with the loaded time
    const $alert = $('<p>').addClass('alert alert-info alert-dismissible');
    $alert.text(`Page loaded at ${DateTime.now().toLocaleString()}`);
    $alert.append($('<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>'));
    $('.container').append($alert);
});
```

When we re-build our page with `npm run build` we'll see the alert, and it will have a close button, but it won't actually close! This is because we've not imported and of Bootstrap's JavaScript yet.

We could import all of the Boostrap JavaScript into a variable named `BS` like so:

```js
// import All Bootstrap JavaScript
import * as BS from 'bootstrap'
```

But it's much better practice to only import what you actually need, so in our case, that's Bootstrap's `Alert` plugin, which we can import with:

```js
// import Bootstrap's Alert plugin
import { Alert } from 'bootstrap'
```

With the JavaScript available, we now need to initialise our alert as an actual Bootstrap 5 alert by adding the following before appending the alert into the DOM:

```js
new Alert($alert[0]);
```

Note that Bootstrap 4 used jQuery but Bootstrap 5 does not, so to initialise  a Bootstrap 5 Alert we need to pass the raw DOM object represented by the jQuery object `$alert`. The simplest way to access the raw DOM objects represented by a jQuery object is using the jQuery object's array-like properties, so the first raw DOM object represented by a jQuery object will always be at `[0]`. Since `$alert` represents exactly one DOM object, we access it via `$alert[0]`.

We can now re-build our app with `npm run build`, and now the close button works to dismiss the alert.

![The app with the a working dismissible Bootstrap 5 Alert](assets/pbs138/screenshot-7-withBootstrapAlert.png)

You'll find the full updated HTML and JavaScript files in the `pbs138a-4/src` folder in the instalment ZIP.
