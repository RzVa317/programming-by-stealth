# PBS 121 of X — Introduction Chezmoi TO IMPROVE

Many open source tools use so-called *dot files* to store their configuration. These are human-readable and editable plain-text files that originated in the Unix/Linux world where they were generally stored at the root of a user's home directory in files or folders with names starting with a `.` symbol to hide them from directory listings (the `ls` command). With the release of Mac OS X Apple joined the POSIX world and *dot files* became common on there too. Many open source tools retained their *dot files* when they were ported to Windows, though they were often re-named to names that don't start with a dot.

Git is a good example of this — all your *global* (account-wide) settings are stored in a dot file. On POSIX systems that's `~/.gitconfig`, and on Windows it's `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.gitconfig`. If you choose to configure a global git ignore file in the normal way you'll also have `~/.gitignore_global` or `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.gitignore_global`.

When you use the `git config --global` command it's editing your `.gitconfig` file on your behalf. Also, many GUI clients will edit this file if you use them to change Git settings. The chances are, by this stage in this series, you have a global git config file:

```
cat ~/.gitconfig
```
