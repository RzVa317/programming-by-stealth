# PBS 108 of X — More Branching

In the previous instalment we introduced the concept of a branching policy to guide your decisions on why to branch, when to branch, and how to merge your branches. We described a very simplistic initial branching policy for this series.

We learned how to create branches with `git branch`, and we learned that `git merge` supports two mechanisms for merging branches — full-on *merge commits*, and light-weight *fast forward merges*.

We implemented our branching policy by adding a `dev` branch to our example repo, adding a commit to that branch to fix a typo, and then using a fast-forward merge to bring that commit into the `main` branch.

In this instalment we'll take things a little further but using multiple commits on the `dev` branch to implement a feature, and then using a merge commit to bring only the final commit into the `main` branch, leaving the half-working intermedia commits to exist only on the `dev` branch.

## Instalment Resources

* The instalment ZIP file — [pbs108.zip](https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth/raw/master/instalmentZips/pbs108.zip).

## Playing Along

If you're like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change into the folder you extracted the ZIP into. You'll find a file in there named `pbs108a.bundle`, this is a bundled version of the repository we created in the previous instalment, with an additional commit added to update the references to the instalment number from 107 to 108.

Like we did in the previous two instalments, we need to make a new repository and import all the commits from the bundle. We'll name our new repository `pbs108a`. To create this new repo we'll take the following steps:

1. create a folder named `pbs108a`
2. change into that folder
3. initialise it as a Git repo
4. if needed, change the default branch from `master` to `main`
5. import all the commits from the bundle into our new repository

The commands to do all this are

```
mkdir pbs108a
cd pbs108a
git init
[ `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` = 'master' ] && git checkout -b main
git pull ../pbs108a.bundle
```

## Two Useful Shortcuts

### Branch & Change

### Stage & Commit

## Adding a More Complex Feature on `Dev`

Let's start by using our dev branch to add a more complex feature that will take us more than one commit to implement.

```
git checkout -b dev
```
### Adding Support for Bootstrap JS Features

TO DO

```
git commit -am 'chore: added Bootstrap JS support'
```
