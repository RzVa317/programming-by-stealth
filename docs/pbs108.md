# PBS 108 of X — More Branching

In the previous instalment we introduced the concept of a branching policy to guide your decisions on why to branch, when to branch, and how to merge your branches. We described a very simplistic initial branching policy for this series.

We learned how to create branches with `git branch`, and we learned that `git merge` supports two mechanisms for merging branches — full-on *merge commits*, and light-weight *fast forward merges*.

We implemented our branching policy by adding a `dev` branch to our example repo, adding a commit to that branch to fix a typo, and then using a fast-forward merge to bring that commit into the `main` branch.

In this instalment we'll take things a little further but using multiple commits on the `dev` branch to implement a feature, and then using a merge commit to bring only the final commit into the `main` branch, leaving the half-working intermedia commits to exist only on the `dev` branch.

## Instalment Resources

* The instalment ZIP file — [pbs108.zip](https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth/raw/master/instalmentZips/pbs108.zip).

## Playing Along

If you're like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change into the folder you extracted the ZIP into. You'll find a file in there named `pbs108a.bundle`, this is a bundled version of the repository we created in the previous instalment, with an additional commit added to update the references to the instalment number from 107 to 108.

Like we did in the previous two instalments, we need to make a new repository and import all the commits from the bundle. We'll name our new repository `pbs108a`. To create this new repo we'll take the following steps:

1. create a folder named `pbs108a`
2. change into that folder
3. initialise it as a Git repo
4. if needed, change the default branch from `master` to `main`
5. import all the commits from the bundle into our new repository

The commands to do all this are

```
mkdir pbs108a
cd pbs108a
git init
[ `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` = 'master' ] && git checkout -b main
git pull ../pbs108a.bundle
```

## Adding a More Complex Feature — A Carousel

As a more real-world example, let's replace the list of *Hello World* code snippets with a sliding [Bootstrap Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/).

This will be a two-step process because we are currently only including the Bootstrap CSS in our page, not the Bootstrap JavaScript, and the Carousel component requires JavaScript.

Our first step will be to add support for Bootstrap JavaScript to our project, then, we'll convert the single large `<pre>` tag containing all the *Hello World* snippets to a carrousel, with one snippet per slide.

### Before We Start — Create Our `dev` Branch

Because our `dev` branch had nothing on it before I created the bundle it doesn't actually exit in our new repository, so let's make use of our new-discovered short-cut and create a new `dev` and check it out:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git checkout -b dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart%
```

### Adding Support for Bootstrap JS Features

To add support for Bootstrap's JS I had to add both Bootstrap's own JS file, and jQuery. I did that by adding the additional files into the `contrib` folder, and then updating the HTML to include the newly added files by adding the following to the bottom of the page body:

```html
<!-- Include the jQuery & Bootstrap JS Libraries -->
<script src="contrib/jQuery3.5/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

You'll find a copy of my updated `contrib` folder and html file in the folder `pbs108a-v2` in this instalment's ZIP file. Completely replace the `contrib` folder in your working copy with this folder, and replace the `index.html` file in your working copy with the one in the folder.

Let's have a look at the state of the working copy now:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git status
On branch dev
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
	contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map
	contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.min.css.map
	contrib/jQuery3.5/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% 
```

Notice that we have un-tracked files as well as changed files. If we were to use the `git commit -am` shortcut now only the one changed file would get committed. We need to add the un-tracked files before we can use the shortcut:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git add contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js* contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.min.css.map contrib/jQuery3.5/
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% 
```

If we look at the status again we can see all files are now tracked:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git status
On branch dev
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
	new file:   contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map
	new file:   contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.min.css.map
	new file:   contrib/jQuery3.5/LICENSE.txt
	new file:   contrib/jQuery3.5/jquery.min.js
	new file:   contrib/jQuery3.5/jquery.min.map

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html

bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart%
```

Now we're ready to use our shortcut to stage and commit in one command:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git commit -am 'wip: added Bootstrap JS support'
[dev dda52e5] wip: added Bootstrap JS support
 7 files changed, 36 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
 create mode 100644 contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map
 create mode 100644 contrib/Bootstrap4.5/bootstrap.min.css.map
 create mode 100644 contrib/jQuery3.5/LICENSE.txt
 create mode 100644 contrib/jQuery3.5/jquery.min.js
 create mode 100644 contrib/jQuery3.5/jquery.min.map
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% 
```

### Adding the Carousel

We're now ready to add the carousel by updating `index.html` as described in the Bootstrap docs.

I opted for a carousel with almost all the bells and whistles, adding navigation buttons, place indicators, and setting a custom animation time of 3 seconds.

You'll find the updated copy of `index.html` in the folder `pbs108a-v3` in this instalment's ZIP. Replace the html file in your working copy with this file.

Let's look at the current state of the repo:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git status                                      
On branch dev
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart%
```

This time there are no untracked files, so we can immediately make use of the `git commit -am` shortcut to stage and commit with a single command:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git commit -am 'wip: converted programming history from single pre to carousel'
[dev 9c96f73] wip: converted programming history from single pre to carousel
 1 file changed, 71 insertions(+), 18 deletions(-)
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% 
```

As seen in GitKraken, our repository now looks like this:

![The dev branch is two commits ahead of the main branch](assets/screenshot-1-GitKraken-beforeMerge.png)

Notice that the `dev` branch is two commits ahead of the `main` branch, but they are displayed in a straight line because `main` can be fast forwarded to `dev`.

In this case the intermediate commit is not really a working version, it loads a bunch of JavaScript that goes completely un-used! If we were to fast forward we would add both commits to the `main` branch, so rather than fast forwarding, we'll force a merge commit.

In the previous instalment we used `git merge` with the `--ff-only` flag for force a fast forward, this time we'll use the `--no-ff` flag to prevent a fast forward and force a merge commit. We wish to merge `dev` into main, so we must first switch to `main`, then merge `dev`.

Because a merge commit is a commit, we need to add a message. Since we made two changes on the `dev` branch we need to add a more verbose commit message. This is a good opportunity to point out that multiple paragraphs can be added to a single commit message by adding multiple `-m` flags. The first one will be considered the heading, all the rest regular paragraphs. This works with both `git commit` and `git merge`.

Let's go ahead and merge our new feature into the main branch. To do that we first check out `main`, then merge `dev` into it without fast forwarding:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
bart-imac2018:pbs108a bart% git merge --no-ff dev -m 'feat: replaced static programming history in Hello Worlds with carousel' -m 'To facilitate the carousel the Bootstrap JavaScript libraries and their dependencies were also added.'
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

```

Let's see how this looks in GitKraken now:

![The main branch now has a merge commit which puts it one ahead of dev](assets/screenshot-2-GitKraken-afterMerge.png)

As you can see, a new commit has appeared on `main`, and that commit has two parent commits, one on `main`, and one on `dev`.
