# PBS 142 of X — The XKPasswdJS Project Kickoff

We've been working our way up to this point for almost a year, but we finally have all the prerequisites needed to formally start the project to port the [`Crypt::HSXKPasswd` Perl module](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::HSXKPasswd) JavaScript!

This is an unusual instalment, because the notes are simply the version of the new GitHub project's `README.md` file at the time the project was launched.

Obviously that file will change over time, so thanks to the magic of Git, this link will always take you to the file as it was when the matching podcast episode was recorded — [github.com/…](https://github.com/bartificer/xkpasswd-js/blob/1a75cb3947ecf0624a4f3eac65640d5c51de571c/README.md)
