# PBS 118 of X — JavaScript Apps with GitHub Pages

Before we finish our look at Git and GitHub be learning how to interact with the open source community, let's take a little detour into one of GitHub's nicest little bonuses, GitHub Pages. Basically, GitHub pages gives you free client-side web hosting with Git-managed source code for free!

OK — let's set some expectations here, when I say it's basic I mean it — you can't run server-side code on it, and there's no database server included, so you can't install common PHP+MySQL apps like Wordpress or Drupal on it. But, even with it's limitations it's perfect for hosting home pages and documentation for serious projects, or, for hosting entire Javascript-based apps.

Our focus is going to be on using GitHub pages to host JavaScript apps, but, we will start by previewing the functionality it offers for delivering more traditional web pages first.

## Using GitHib Pages to Host Simple Web Pages

If you like, you can simply host some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files on GitHub Pages to create a simple site from scratch.

But, you don't have to code your own HTML, you can write your content in Markdown and have GitHub convert it to HTML for you!

### Markdown Files on GitHub Pages

One of GutHub Pages most powerful built-in features is that it can behave like a so-called *static site generator*, that is to say, a tool that takes input in a format that's not HTML, and generates an HTML-based website from that information automatically.

GitHub Pages does this using the open source Jekyll static site builder. You don't have to do anything special to enable the Jekyll functionality — just commit some Markdown files and GitHub Pages will take it from there. By default your pages will be converted to HTML using a very plain template, but you can choose from a number of pre-provided templates, link to a template written by someone else, or, write your own template from scratch.

The PBS website is entirely written in Markdown, and the web pages you see are produced using a custom Jekyll theme I wrote myself. You can see the code powering the PBS website in [the `docs` folder in the `programming-by-stealth` repo](https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth/tree/master/docs), and you can see the code for the custom theme the site uses in the [`bartificer-jekyll-theme` repo](https://github.com/bartificer/bartificer-jekyll-theme).
