# PBS 110 of X — Merge Conflicts

As our branching strategy has evolved it's sprouted ever more simultaneously edited branches. The more branches under active development, the greater the chance there will be merge conflicts. So far Up to this point I've been very careful with how I've structured the examples to ensure there were never any conflicts. In this instalment I've done the opposite — intentionally engineered a conflict so we can learn how to resolve it!

## Instalment Resources

* The instalment ZIP file — [pbs110.zip](https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth/raw/master/instalmentZips/pbs110.zip).

## Playing Along 

If you're like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change into the folder you extracted the ZIP into. You'll find a file in there named `pbs110a.bundle`, this is a bundled version of the repository we created in the previous instalment, with some additional commits added to prepare the ground for a merge commit. We'll look at these commits in detail later.

Like we did in the previous two instalments, we need to make a new repository and import all the branches and tags from the bundle. We'll name our new repository `pbs110a`. To create this new repo we'll take the following steps:

1. create a folder named `pbs110a`
2. change into that folder
3. initialise it as a Git repo
4. if needed, change the default branch from `master` to `main`
5. import all branches and tags from the bundle into our new repository

The commands to do all this are

```
mkdir pbs110a
cd pbs110a
git init
[ `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` = 'master' ] && git checkout -b main
git fetch --update-head-ok ../pbs110a.bundle '*:*'
git checkout main
```

## A Quick Recap on Merging Branches

The `git merge` command is used to integrate the changes on another branch into the currently checked out branch. This means that to merge a dev branch into the `main` branch you must start by checking out the `main` branch.

It's important that the current working copy be clean before attempting a merge. Attempting to merge when there are uncommitted changes will result in an error.

When ever possible Git will automatically merge the changes from the specified branch into the current branch entirely automatically. However, when the same line is edited on both branches some form of human judgement will be needed, so when this happens Git asks it's human master for help by pausing the merge and marking it as being conflicted. A human then needs to come along and make an informed decision on how to resolve the conflict.
