TO DO

## Three Types of Input

Having a script that always does exactly the same thing is useful, but having a script that does the same basic thing but can accept different inputs is much more useful, so let's look at our choices for getting data into our scripts:

1. Commandline arguments
2. Data piped into our script
3. User prompts

### Commandline Arguments

By far the simplest way to get some data in is to accept commandline arguments, i.e. space-separated strings after the name of your script.

Bash makes commandline arguments available to us in our scripts through special variables, `$1` is the first argument, `$2` the second, and so on. The command used to invoke the script is `$0` in case you're wondering ðŸ™‚

The script `pbs144a-argsDemo.sh` shows this in action:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "I am '$0', my first arg is '$1', and my second is '$2'"
```

TO DO â€” SAVE SCRIPT

### Piped Data

Since piping data from one command to another is a very shell-like way to move data around (see instalment TO DO), it often makes sense to write our own scripts to accept input in this way.

## Final Thoughts

We're well on our way to being competent shell scripters â€” we can write and execute scripts, and we can create and use variables in our scripts. In the next instalments we'll move on to dealing with inputs to and outputs from scripts, including passing arguments to scripts, before moving on to look at basic flow controls like conditionals and loops.
