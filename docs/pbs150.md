# PBS 150 of X â€” Bash Script Plumbing

In the previous instalment we learned how to all options to our scripts in the same style as used by typical terminal commands. At this stage our scripts are almost first-class citizens of Terminal-land, they just need to learn one more trick â€” to play nice with command pipelining, or as I like to call it, Terminal plumbing ðŸ™‚

## PBS 149 Challenge Solution

The optional challenge at the end of the previous instalment was to update our  breakfast menu script so it accepts two options:

1. `-l LIMIT` where `LIMIT` is the maximum number of items that can be ordered, which must be a whole number greater than or equal to one.
2. `-s` to request some snark.

Here's my sample solution, which you'll find in the instalment ZIP as `pbs149-challengeSolution.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# read the menu
declare -a menu
while read -r menuLine
do
    # skip comment lines
    echo "$menuLine" | egrep -q '^[ ]*#' && continue

    # skip empty lines
    echo "$menuLine" | egrep -q '^[ ]*$' && continue

    # store the menu item
    menu+=("$menuLine")
done <<<"$(cat $(dirname "$BASH_SOURCE")/menu.txt)"

# initialise the options to their default values
limit='' # no limit
snark='' # no snark

# Process the commandline options
while getopts ':l:s' opt
do
    case $opt in
        l)
            # validate and store the limit
            if echo "$OPTARG" | egrep '^[1-9][0-9]*$'
            then
                limit=$OPTARG
            else
                echo "invalid limit - must be an integer greater than zero"
                exit 2;
            fi
            ;;
        s)
            snark=1
            ;;
        ?)
            echo "Usage: $(basename $0) [-s] [-l LIMIT]"
            exit 2
    esac
done

# create an empty array to hold the order
declare -a order

# present the menu, with a done option
if [[ -z $limit ]]
then
    if [[ -n $snark ]]
    then
        echo "Wha' d' ya want (greed is grand)?"
    else
        echo 'Choose your breakfast (as many items as you like)'
    fi
else
    if [[ -n $snark ]]
    then
        echo "Pick no more than $limit things, and make it snappy!"
    else
        echo "Choose up to $limit breakfast items"
    fi
fi
select item in done "${menu[@]}"
do
    # skip invalid selections ($item is empty)
    [[ -z $item ]] && continue

    # exit if done
    [[ $item == done ]] && break

    # store and print the item
    order+=("$item")
    if [[ -n $snark ]]
    then
        echo "Fine, you can have $item"
    else
        echo "Added $item to your order"
    fi

    # if we're limiting, check the limit
    if [[ -n $limit ]]
    then
        [[ ${#order[@]} -ge $limit ]] && break
    fi
done

# print the order
if [[ -n $snark ]]
then
    echo -e "\nYour sodding ${#order[@]} items:"
else
    echo -e "\nYou ordered the following ${#order[@]} items:"
fi
for item in "${order[@]}"
do
    echo "* $item"
done
```

### An Optional Extra Bonus Challenge

Update your challenge solution from last time to accept the menu via the pileline, or as a path passed as the first argument, only default to `./menu.txt` when nothing was piped to the script, and there is no first arument.
