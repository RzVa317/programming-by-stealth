# PBS 103 of X â€” Getting Started With Git

In the previous instalment we looked at Git from a theoretical point of view â€” we look at what a repository is, and how data is stored. In this instalment we'll move from theory into practice, and create our first Git repository. 

If you'd like to play along you'll need to meet these two prerequisites:

1. You have installed a version of Git on your computer. The Git homepage list many options â€” [git-scm.com/â€¦](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. You are comfortable enough on the command line to navigate to a folder and execute some instructions. (Shameless plug for our free Taming the Terminal podcast & eBook â€” [ttt.bartificer.net/â€¦](https://ttt.bartificer.net/) ðŸ˜‰).

Even if you don't meet these prerequisites, or if you only ever want to use a Git GUI, don't skip this instalment. Knowing what's happening under the hood will help you make better use of Git GUIs!

## Some Quick Revision

The first vital take-away from the previous instalment is that a Git repository has three parts:

1. A **database** that permanently stores committed versions of your creative project.
2. A **working copy** of the files and folders that make up your creative project.
3. An **index** which manages the transition of changes made on the working copy into the database through the use of a staging area (and optional stashes which we'll ignore for now).

The second key takeaway is that a *commit* is a snapshot of the complete state of your creative project.

With the exception of the initial commit, commits are linked to the commit that came before them, creating a chain of changes that reaches all the way back to the initial commit. Many commits can share the same previous commit, so the end result is a branching collection of chains spreading out from the initial commit. Each path from the initial commit to the current final commit on one of these chains is referred to as a *branch*, and we get to name these branches.

## The Git Command

Rather than provide a suite of separate commands for each possible Git action, all Git's functionality is exposed via a single command â€” `git`. The first argument to `git` will always be the specific Git action you wish to perform, so you'll often see Git commands described with the first argument, e.g. *'use the `git commit` command to create a commit'*.

The different Git actions are referred to as *subcommands*, so in the example above, `commit` is the subcommand. While there is a `man` page for the `git` command, it's important to remember that there are separate `man` pages for each Git subcommand, and they are named `git-SUBCOMMAND`, e.g. `man git-commit` for the `commit` subcommand.

## Configuring Git

Git does not need much configuration, but it is important to understand how Git stores the few configuration settings it uses.

### Three Setting Levels 

When Git tries to figure out the value for any given configurable setting it searches in three places, and it does that search in the following order:

1. Firstly, settings can be stored **within a repository**, which Git refers to as a ***local***.
2. Secondly, settings can be stored within your operating system-level user account, which Git confusingly refers to as ***global***.
3. Finally, settings can be stored at the OS-level, which Git refers to as ***system***.

So, when Git needs to know what text editor it should use when asking you to enter a commit message it first checks to see if there is a repository-level or *local* value for that setting, if there is, it uses it, if not, it checks for a user-account-wide or *global* value, again, if it finds one it uses it, but if not, it checks at the OS or *system* level, and again, if it finds a value it uses it, otherwise it falls back on Git's default editor.

Under the hood Git saves all these settings in editable text files at specific OS-dependent paths, but you don't need to know that, because Git doesn't want you editing those files directly!

### Accessing & Editing Git's Settings with `git config`

The subcommand for reading and altering Git settings is `config`, so you can access the relevant `man` page with `man git-config`.

To see a list of all Git settings that apply in your current folder use:

```
git config --list
```

You can use the `--local`, `--global`, and `--system` flags to see only settings at that given level.

As an example, within the PBS repo on my Mac I can see all the settings, regardless of the level they are coming from:

```
bart-imac2018:programming-by-stealth bart% git config --list         
credential.helper=osxkeychain
user.email=opensource@bartificer.net
user.name=Bart Busschots
core.bare=false
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.ignorecase=true
core.precomposeunicode=true
core.logallrefupdates=true
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth.git
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
branch.master.remote=origin
branch.master.merge=refs/heads/master
branch.PBS93.remote=origin
branch.PBS93.merge=refs/heads/PBS93
branch.PBS94.remote=origin
branch.PBS94.merge=refs/heads/PBS94
branch.PBS95.remote=origin
branch.PBS95.merge=refs/heads/PBS95
bart-imac2018:programming-by-stealth bart%
```

I can see which settings are defined at each level by using the three level-related flags in turn:

```
bart-imac2018:programming-by-stealth bart% git config --list --local
core.bare=false
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.ignorecase=true
core.precomposeunicode=true
core.logallrefupdates=true
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth.git
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
branch.master.remote=origin
branch.master.merge=refs/heads/master
branch.PBS93.remote=origin
branch.PBS93.merge=refs/heads/PBS93
branch.PBS94.remote=origin
branch.PBS94.merge=refs/heads/PBS94
branch.PBS95.remote=origin
branch.PBS95.merge=refs/heads/PBS95
bart-imac2018:programming-by-stealth bart% git config --list --global
user.email=opensource@bartificer.net
user.name=Bart Busschots
bart-imac2018:programming-by-stealth bart% git config --list --system
fatal: unable to read config file '/etc/gitconfig': No such file or directory
bart-imac2018:programming-by-stealth bart%
```

As you can see, most of my settings are repository-specific, but I do have two global settings which I use to identify myself.
