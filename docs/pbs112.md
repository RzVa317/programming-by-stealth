# PBS 112 of X â€” Introducing Git Remotes

In our [initial introduction to version control](pbs101) we introduced the concepts of the client-server model and the peer-to-peer model. When we [moved on to Git specifically](pbs102) we learned that Git uses the peer-to-peer model, but from then until now we've utterly ignored that aspect of Git, focusing instead on the basics of using a single repository. We've now covered all this Git basics in enough detail that it's time to broaden our view of the Git universe, and start exploring how Git facilitates collaboration.

Throughout our Git journey we've learned that Git uses English words in very Git-specific ways. Sure, committing had a meaning in English, but it has a different and narrower meaning in Git. We've already picked up a lot of Git jargon in this series-within-a-series, but we're about to encounter a lot more of it, and it's very important we familiarise ourselves with it before we continue.

This entire instalment is going to be dedicated to describing Git's philosophy on collaboration, and the precise meaning Git assigns to otherwise ordinary looking English words like *remote*, *push*, and *pull*. This is the kind of instalment I expect many of you will bookmark for quick reference later.
