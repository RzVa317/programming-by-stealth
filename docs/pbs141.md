# PBS 141 of X — Generating UML Class Diagrams with Mermaid

In the previous instalment we introduced the concept of UML Class Diagrams, explained the problems they solve, and then looked at the sub-set of the UML Class Diagram specification that's most relevant to JavaScript classes. We looked at three important relationships between classes (inheritance, composition & aggregation), and class members (attributes & functions). We also looked at the *Abstract* class annotation, and how to mark class members as *static*.

We could use our favourite diagraming tools to create UML class diagrams, but we can do better, we can write them in a simple plain-text  markup language and then automatically generate our diagrams from that markup. In this instalment we'll learn how to use the open source Mermaid library to turn text into diagrams!
