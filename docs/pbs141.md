# PBS 141 of X — Generating UML Class Diagrams with Mermaid

In the previous instalment we introduced the concept of UML Class Diagrams, explained the problems they solve, and then looked at the sub-set of the UML Class Diagram specification that's most relevant to JavaScript classes. We looked at three important relationships between classes (inheritance, composition & aggregation), and class members (attributes & functions). We also looked at the *Abstract* class annotation, and how to mark class members as *static*.

We could use our favourite diagraming tools to create UML class diagrams, but we can do better, we can write them in a simple plain-text  markup language and then automatically generate our diagrams from that markup. In this instalment we'll learn how to use the open source Mermaid library to turn text into diagrams!

## Installing Mermaid

[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) is written in JavaScript, and it can be used in many ways. At its most fundamental level its a JavaScript module you can use in your own JavaScript code for creating diagrams, and it's available in NPM as [`mermaid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mermaid). There's also a live web interface at [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) which can be useful for experimenting. What we'll be using though is a command line wrapper around the library which is also available in NPM as [`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli).

To use Mermaid, start by creating a folder in which you'll be working, then open that folder in a terminal and install the Mermaid CLI with the command:

```sh
npm install --save @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

Once the package is installed in the folder you'll be able to invoke the CLI version of Mermaid with `npx mmdc`.

## Play Along

If you'd like to play along with the examples in this instalment, open the folder `pbs141-a` from the instalment ZIP in a terminal and install the Mermaid CLI as above.

To be sure `mmdc` is working, build a simple diagram with the command:

```sh
npx mmdc --scale 2 -i helloWorld.mmd.txt -o helloWorld.png
```

This will generate a very simple diagram with two empty classes (`Waffle` & `Pancake`) with no relationship between them:

If we look at the contents of this demo file we can see what its markup looks like:

```
classDiagram-v2
    class Pancake {
    }
    class Waffle {
    }
```

## Basic Mermaid Syntax

A single Mermaid file can contain multiple diagrams, so the first thing you delcare is the type of diagram you are about to define, for us, for now, that will always be `classDiagram-v2`. The definitions for a diagram are added underneath the type declaration, indented by a consisten ammount.

Each diffent diagram type has its own rules for adding elements and relationships, so we'll be confining ourselves to just the UML class diagram syntax. In fact, we confined ourselves to just a sub-set of UML in the previous instalment, and we'll be confining ourselves to the same subset of Mermain. Finally, there are multiple valid Mermiaid syntaxes for achieving some things, to keep things simple we'll only be looking at one way of doing each thing we do. In other words, we'll be looking at just a sub-set of a sub-set of a subset of the full Mermaid syntax!

Comments can be added by starting a line with `%%`.

## Mermaid Class Diagram Syntax

Afer we start our diagram with `classDiagram-v2` we need to start by adding our classes.

### Adding Classes

Each class definition start with the name of the class, then a space, then an opening curly brace, then one or more lines for members, then a closing brace on a line by itself. This fully explains the syntax in our test example above.

### Adding Class Annotations

### Adding Class Members

#### Atributes

#### Functions
