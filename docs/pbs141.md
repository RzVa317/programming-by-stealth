# PBS 141 of X — Generating UML Class Diagrams with Mermaid

In the previous instalment we introduced the concept of UML Class Diagrams, explained the problems they solve, and then looked at the sub-set of the UML Class Diagram specification that's most relevant to JavaScript classes. We looked at three important relationships between classes (inheritance, composition & aggregation), and class members (attributes & functions). We also looked at the *Abstract* class annotation, and how to mark class members as *static*.

We could use our favourite diagraming tools to create UML class diagrams, but we can do better, we can write them in a simple plain-text  markup language and then automatically generate our diagrams from that markup. In this instalment we'll learn how to use the open source Mermaid library to turn text into diagrams!

## Installing Mermaid

[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) is written in JavaScript, and it can be used in many ways. At its most fundamental level its a JavaScript module you can use in your own JavaScript code for creating diagrams, and it's available in NPM as [`mermaid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mermaid). There's also a live web interface at [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) which can be useful for experimenting. What we'll be using though is a command line wrapper around the library which is also available in NPM as [`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli).

To use Mermaid, start by creating a folder in which you'll be working, then open that folder in a terminal and install the Mermaid CLI with the command:

```sh
npm install --save @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

Once the package is installed in the folder you'll be able to invoke the CLI version of Mermaid with `npx mmdc`.

## Play Along

If you'd like to play along with the examples in this instalment, open the folder `pbs141-a` from the instalment ZIP in a terminal and install the Mermaid CLI as above.

To be sure `mmdc` is working, build a simple diagram with the command:

```sh
npx mmdc --scale 2 -i helloWorld.mmd.txt -o helloWorld.png
```
