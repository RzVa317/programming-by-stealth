# PBS 124 of X â€” Chezmoi on Multiple Machines

At this stage in our [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) journey we've learned how to manage and version our *dot files*. We've learned that Chezmoi stores its version history in Git, and hence, that we can use a remote Git repository as a backup of our dot files.

We made a start on exploring the power to templating within Chezmoi â€” we learned how to define data, and how include that data in templates using the text/template syntax from the Go language. Specifically, we learned how to use the dot notation to include single values, and the `range` action to iterate over arrays and objects.

To keep things simple, I avoided using text/template jargon in the previous instalment, but we need to remedy that before we can move on to explore three powerful text/template features we'll need to master before we can start to use Chezmoi across multiple machines effectively.

Specifically, we'll be looking at:

1. comment actions
2. conditional actions
3. functions
4. variables
5. pipelines

## Chezmoi Templates Without the Training Wheels

First things first, in text/template it's all about *actions* â€” that's the correct jargon for the thing that goes inside the pairs of curly braces.

So far we've seen two actions, one specific type of *pipeline* for outputting single values (the dot notation), and the `range` action.

Pipelines are made up of one or more steps separate from each other with the pipe symbol (`|`), with the output from one step feeding into the next. In the previous instalment, all our pipelines consisted of a single part.












## Conditionals in Chezmoi Templates

The Text/Template templating engine used by Chezmoi provides three *tags* for defining conditional content â€” ``{{ if (CONDITION) }}`, `{{ else }}`, and `{{ end }}`. These can be combined in a few different ways.

The simplest scenario is simply some optional content:

```
{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os "darwin") }}
This text will only be included on Macs (Darwin is Apple's port of BSD that powers macOS).
{{ end }}
```

The next simplest scenario is two alternative pieces of content:

```
{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os "darwin") }}
This text will only be included on Macs.
{{ else }}
This text will be included everywhere but Macs.
{{ end }}
```

And finally, we can have multiple possible alternative pieces of content:

```
{{ if (eq .chezmoi.os "darwin") }}
This text will only be included on Macs.
{{ else if (eq .chezmoi.os "linux") }}
This text will only be included on Linux machines.
{{ else }}
This text will only be included on machines that are neither Macs nor running Linux.
{{ end }}
```

### Comparison Operators

Under the hood Text/Templates implements the boolean operators as functions, and functions are included in templates by their name followed by a space-delimited list of arguments. This results in a pre-fix notation where you specify the type of comparison you want, and then list the values to compare. The examples above all use the `eq` function which checks for *equality*, but there are more functions available:

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `eq` | **is Equal**, equivalent to `==` in JavaScript. |
| `ne` | **is Not Equal**, equivalent to `!=` in JavaScript. |
| `lt`| **is Less Than**, equivalent to `<` in JavaScript. |
| `le`| **is Less Than or Equal**, equivalent to `<=` in JavaScript. |
| `gt`| **is Greater Than**, equivalent to `>` in JavaScript. |
| `ge`| **is Greater Than or Equal**, equivalent to `>=` in JavaScript. |

### Boolean Functions

As well as providing functions for making comparisons, Text/Template also provides basic boolean functions:

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `not` | Inverts its argument, equivalent to `!` in JavaScript. |
| `and` | A boolean **and**, equivalent to `&&` in JavaScript. |
| `oe` | A boolean **or**, equivalent to `||` in JavaScript. |

### Complex Logic

We can combine the comparison and boolean functions to construct arbitrarily complex logical expressions. We just need to use brackets to group each function call. Note that the brackets wrap the name of the function and the arguments, not just the arguments, e.g.:

```
{{ if (and (eq .chezmoi.os "darwin") (eq .chezmoi.version.builtBy "HomeBrew")) }}
You're one of the smart Mac users, you use homebrew ðŸ™‚
{{ end }}
```
