# PBS 148 of X — Little Bash Gotchas

For various reasons myself and Allison need to produce this next episode a little earlier than planned, so our explorations of `getopts` and piping data through our scripts is moving to the next instalment. In this instalment we'll focus on a sample solution to the challenge set at the end of the previous instalment, and we'll use that as an excuse to explore some important details and nuances we need to cover, but don't fit well into the general narrative.
