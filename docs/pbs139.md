# PBS 139 of X — Bundling a Web App with Webpack

In the previous instalment we introduced the concepts for using Webpack to bundle a web app or web site rather than a JavaScript library, and we made a good start on a worked example that already successfully bundled our own HTML, CSS & JS, jQuery, Luxon, and the Bootstrap 5 CSS. In this instalment we'll pick up where we left off and add Mustache templates and the Bootstrap 5 JavaScript to our bundle, as well as an icon font and a web font.

## Continuing our Worked Example

At the end of the previous instalment our worked example had just had a Bootstrap Alert added that showed the time the page was loaded at. This alert was generated with jQuery, and used Luxon to generate the date information.

That code will form the starting point for this instalment, but with the instalment numbers incremented appropriately. You'll find this version of the app in the `pbs139a-startingPoint` folder in the instalment ZIP. To see the app in action open a terminal in the folder and run `npm ci && npm run build`, then open `docs/index.html` in your browser.

You'll find the finished final version of the code for this worked example in the folder `pbs139a` in this instalment's ZIP. You can see it in action by opening that folder in the terminal, running the same command as above, and opening the generated `docs/index.html` in your browser.

If you'd like to play along and build this final version of the code as you listen/read, copy the folder `pbs139a-startingPoint` from the ZIP open a terminal there, and make all your changes in that copy of the folder. To initialise your copy, open it in terminal and run the command `npm ci` to download the needed NodeJS modules.

### Step 6 — Refactor the Alert to use a Mustache Template

### Step 7 — Import Boostrap JavaScript

Our first task in this instalment is to use Bootstrap's JavaScript to make the alert we added in Step 5 in the previous instalment dismissible.

LEFT OFF HERE!!! -- lines below are from pbs138 draft!

We can then update our event handler to inject a dismissible Bootstrap alert into the end of our container like so:

```js
// a jQuery document ready handler
$(()=>{
    // update the greeting to show jQuery ran
    $('#world-modifier').text('jQuery');

    // build and add an alert with the loaded time
    const $alert = $('<p>').addClass('alert alert-info alert-dismissible');
    $alert.text(`Page loaded at ${DateTime.now().toLocaleString()}`);
    $alert.append($('<button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>'));
    $('.container').append($alert);
});
```

When we re-build our page with `npm run build` we'll see the alert, and it will have a close button, but it won't actually close! This is because we've not imported and of Bootstrap's JavaScript yet.

We could import all of the Boostrap JavaScript into a variable named `BS` like so:

```js
// import All Bootstrap JavaScript
import * as BS from 'bootstrap'
```

But it's much better practice to only import what you actually need, so in our case, that's Bootstrap's `Alert` plugin, which we can import with:

```js
// import Bootstrap's Alert plugin
import { Alert } from 'bootstrap'
```

With the JavaScript available, we now need to initialise our alert as an actual Bootstrap 5 alert by adding the following before appending the alert into the DOM:

```js
new Alert($alert[0]);
```

Note that Bootstrap 4 used jQuery but Bootstrap 5 does not, so to initialise  a Bootstrap 5 Alert we need to pass the raw DOM object represented by the jQuery object `$alert`. The simplest way to access the raw DOM objects represented by a jQuery object is using the jQuery object's array-like properties, so the first raw DOM object represented by a jQuery object will always be at `[0]`. Since `$alert` represents exactly one DOM object, we access it via `$alert[0]`.

We can now re-build our app with `npm run build`, and now the close button works to dismiss the alert.
