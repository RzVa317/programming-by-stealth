# PBS 106 of X — Time Travel with Git

In the previous instalment we learned to look back in time with `git diff`, to export the contents of our repository from some point in the past with `git archive`, and finally, to travel to the past by using `git checkout` to bring load the contents of an arbitrary commit into our working directory.

We did out time travel very cautiously, we make sure to have a clean working copy before checking out the commit form the past, and we made sure not to change anything in the working copy while we were in the past because Git can't commit changes while our currently checked out commit is not at the *head* (end) of a branch. We learned that Git refers to this state somewhat melodramatically as a *detached head state*.

The focus of this instalment will be to travel through time while keeping our *head* attached!

## Playing Along

If you're like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change into the folder you extracted the ZIP into. You'll find a file in there named `pbs106a.bundle`, this is a bundled version of the repository we created in the previous instalment, with a few additional commit added so we have something to go back in time to fetch.

Like we did in the previous instalment, we need to make a new repository and import all the commits from the bundle. We'll name our new repository `pbs106a`. To create this new repo we'll take the following steps:

1. create a folder named `pbs106a`
2. change into that folder
3. initialise it as a Git repo
4. if needed, change the default branch from `master` to `main`
5. import all the commits from the bundle into our new repository

The commands to do all this are

```
mkdir pbs106a
cd pbs106a
git init
[ `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` = 'master' ] && git checkout -b main
git pull ../pbs106a.bundle
```

We can now verify that we've imported a full history of commits with `git log`:

## Final Thoughts

In this instalment we learned to look into the past, but not bring versions of files from the past back to the future, or forward to a new alternative future. We'll learn how to do both of those things in the next instalment. That is to say, we'll learn how to use stashes to bring changes from the past back to the future we came from, and how to create new branches to move towards alternative futures.
