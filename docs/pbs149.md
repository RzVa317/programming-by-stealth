## PBS 148 Challenge Solution

The optional challenge at the end of the previous instalment was to update our  breakfast menu script to it can optionally accept an argument â€” a limit on the number of items you can order.

Here's my sample solution, which you'll find in the instalment ZIP as `pbs148-challengeSolution.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# read the menu
declare -a menu
while read -r menuLine
do
    # skip comment lines
    echo "$menuLine" | egrep -q '^[ ]*#' && continue

    # skip empty lines
    echo "$menuLine" | egrep -q '^[ ]*$' && continue

    # store the menu item
    menu+=("$menuLine")
done <<<"$(cat $(dirname "$BASH_SOURCE")/menu.txt)"

# default to unlimited items, then check if there is a first argument
limit=''
if [[ -n $1 ]]
then
    # validate the argument
    if echo "$1" | egrep '^[1-9][0-9]*$'
    then
        limit=$1
    else
        echo "invalid argument '$1' - must be a whole number greater than 0"
        exit 2 # custom exit code for bad arg
    fi
fi

# create an empty array to hold the order
declare -a order

# present the menu, with a done option
if [[ -z $limit ]]
then
    echo 'Choose your breakfast (as many items as you like)'
else
    echo "Choose up to $limit breakfast items"
fi
select item in done "${menu[@]}"
do
    # skip invalid selections ($item is empty)
    [[ -z $item ]] && continue

    # exit if done
    [[ $item == done ]] && break

    # store and print the item
    order+=("$item")
    echo "Added $item to your order"

    # if we're limiting, check the limit
    if [[ -n $limit ]]
    then
        [[ ${#order[@]} -ge $limit ]] && break
    fi
done

# print the order
echo -e "\nYou ordered the following ${#order[@]} items:"
for item in "${order[@]}"
do
    echo "* $item"
done
```

This solution doesn't use anything we've not technically covered, but there are two related things I'd like to draw your attention to.

Firstly, I think this is the first time my examples have made use of the `-n` test for *not zero-length*, it's basically the inverse of `-z` which tests for a length of zero. I first use it to see if an optional first argument (`$1`) was passed:

```bash
if [[ -n $1 ]]
```

Secondly, I chose to use a blank limit to represent an absence of any limit. The reason is quite simple, it allows both `-z` and `-n` to be used to quickly test for the presence or absence of a limit, e.g.:

```bash
# if there's no limit
if [[ -z $limit ]]
then
    echo 'Choose your breakfast (as many items as you like)'
else
    echo "Choose up to $limit breakfast items"
fi

# â€¦

# if there is a limit
if [[ -n $limit ]]
then
    [[ ${#order[@]} -ge $limit ]] && break
fi
```

## Special POSIX Variables

Before we can move on to learning how to add traditional terminal-style *flags* to our own scripts, we need a more detailed understanding of how Bash handles arguments, and before we can do that, we need to formally introduce a concept we've already met informally â€” the special POSIX variables that are available in **all** [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant shells, including Bash.

We've actually already seen some of these variables, but we've not mentioned that they're bigger than Bash, that they're actually part of the much more general POSIX standard. Here's a table of the most important special POSIX variables):

| POSIX Variable | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `$PATH` | A list of locations to search for executables (see TTT XXX ) |
| `$HOME` ðŸ†• |  The path to the current user's home directory |
| `$IFS` ðŸ†• | The *Input Field Separator* is a powerful but dangerous variable that should be used with extreme caution because it subtly affects the operation of multiple commands, so it's very prone to the kind of *spooky action at a distance* bugs that will drive you nuts! We may cover it later in the series. |
| `$?` | The exit code of the previously executed command |
| `$$` ðŸ†• | The process ID (PID) of the currently running script |
| `$!` ðŸ†• | The process ID (PID) of the most recently started background task (we're going to ignore this one) |
| `$0` ðŸ†• | The name of the currently running script |
| `$1` â€¦ `$9` | The positional arguments |
| `$#` ðŸ†• | The number of arguments passed  to the script |
| `$*` ðŸ†• | A pseudo-array of all the arguments concatenated, then split on spaces (details to follow) |
| `$@` ðŸ†• | A pseudo-array of all the arguments (details to follow) |

I want to focus on the symbol-style POXIV variables in this instalment, and most especially, the three argument-related ones we've not met before â€” `$#`, `$*`, and `$@`.

### The Number of Args (`$#`)

By far the simplest of these three to understand is `$#`, it's just a number, 0 if there were no arguments passed, 1, if there was one passed, and so on. You can see it in action in the very simple script `pbs149a-numArgs.sh` in the instalment ZIP:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "You passed $# args"
```

If you call the script without args you'll see it return  `0`, if you cll the script with just the single argument 42 you'll see it returns `1`, and if you call the script with a quoted argument, it does the sensible thing:

```bash
./pbs149a-numArgs.sh 42 'life universe everything'
# returns: You passed 2 args
```

### The `$*` & `$@` Expansions

These variables are weird! They're referred to as *expansions*, because like `*.txt` they expand out into a list of arbitrarily many arguments. The two are almost the same, but they differ in a subtle but very important way â€” they split the args up differently. `$*` also has the extra complexity that it's behaviour is altered by the input field separator (`$IFS`), so it's vulnerable to spooky action at a distance. To see how they differ, let's use a simple demo script (`pbs149b-argsExpansions.sh` in the instalment ZIP):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "You passed $# args"
echo ''
echo 'Un-quoted $* expands them to:'
for a in $*
do
    echo "* $a"
done
echo ''
echo 'Un-quoted $@ expands them to:'
for a in $@
do
    echo "* $a"
done
echo ''
echo 'Quoted $* expands them to:'
for a in "$*"
do
    echo "* $a"
done
echo ''
echo 'Quoted $@ expands them to:'
for a in "$@"
do
    echo "* $a"
done
```

When we run this script with a simple arg and a quoted arg with spaces like so:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "You passed $# args"
echo ''
echo 'Un-quoted $* expands them to:'
for a in $*
do
    echo "* $a"
done
echo ''
echo 'Un-quoted $@ expands them to:'
for a in $@
do
    echo "* $a"
done
echo ''
echo 'Quoted $* expands them to:'
for a in "$*"
do
    echo "* $a"
done
echo ''
echo 'Quoted $@ expands them to:'
for a in "$@"
do
    echo "* $a"
done
```

We get the following behaviour for the four ways to use these two variables:

```text
You passed 2 args

Un-quoted $* expands them to:
* 42
* life
* universe
* everything

Un-quoted $@ expands them to:
* 42
* life
* universe
* everything

Quoted $* expands them to:
* 42 life universe everything

Quoted $@ expands them to:
* 42
* life universe everything
```

Looking at those outputs, the vast majority of the time, it's the final option, `"$@"` that gives the behaviour you'll want 99.9% of the time.

### Arguments â†’ Bash Arrays

Finally, you'll often want to access your arguments as traditional array, you can do that by combing Bash's array creation syntax with the `"$@"` POSIX args expansion, i.e. `("$@")`, as demonstrated in `pbs149c-argsArray.sh` in the installment ZIP:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# store the passed args in an array named $args (could be any name)
args=("$@")

# demo array
echo "The array \$args contains ${#args[@]} items:"
for a in "${args[@]}"
do
    echo "* $a"
done
```

If we run this script with the simple and quoted example args we've been using in the previous examples:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# store the passed args in an array named $args (could be any name)
args=("$@")

# demo array
echo "The array \$args contains ${#args[@]} items:"
for a in "${args[@]}"
do
    echo "* $a"
done
```

We can see the args have been properly captured in the array, one array element per arg:

```text
The array $args contains 2 items:
* 42
* life universe everything
```
