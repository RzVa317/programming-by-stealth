## Loops Commands in Bash

Bash supports three loop commands — `while`, `until`, and `for`. All three need to be used in conjunction with the `do` and `done` commands. The code takes the form below, where `loop_command` is one of `while`, `until`, or `for`, and `loop_details` is different for different types of loop:

```bash
loop_command loop_details
do
    # some commands
done
```

The three loops are designed to create maximally readable code in three distinct scenarios:

1. **While loops** are designed to repeat commands while some condition remains true. E.g. *keep trying this command until it succeeds*.
2. **Until loops** are the inverse of while loops, they are designed to repeat commands while some condition remains false. E.g. *keep asking for input until you get a valid day of the week*.
3. **For loops** are designed to repeat the same command once with each of a list of values. E.g. *print the reverse of each line in this file*.
