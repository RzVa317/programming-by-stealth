# PBS 143 of X — Shell Script Basics

In [the previous instalment](./pbs142) we described the project structure we'll be using for the port of the [`Crypt::HSXKPasswd` Perl module](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::HSXKPasswd) to JavaScript. One of the folders in that structure is `/buildScripts/`, which we described as containing the various scripts that will be used to build the project. These scripts will be shell scripts, which are new to us, so it makes sense to spend a little time learning some shell scripting basics at this stage. This won't be an exhastive look at shell scripting, far from it, we'll just be focusing on what we need for the build scripts. Our focus will be on script portability, variables, conditional statements, loops, and error handling. In other words, the most basic programming fundamentals.

## The Absolute Fundamentals — Hello Shell World

Just to be clear, when we use the term *shell* in this series we're using it as an abbreviation for the technically correct term *command shell*. As described in detail in [the first instalment of the Taming the Terminal series](https://ttt.bartificer.net/book.html#ttt01), a command shell is an environment for executing terminal commands. A termninal window is simply an interactive command shell. So, each time we've used the terminal in this series we've been using our OS's default command shell. Shell scripts simply automate the process of entering terminal commands — the first line of a shell script tells the OS which shell to use to execute the remaining lines as commands.

### Why Bash?

The shell scripts we'll be using in the XKPasswd project will use the [Bash shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). Bash is an extended and improved version of the original Unix shell (`sh`), and it was itself extended and improved to form the [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (`zsh`). Why use Bash and not the more modern Zsh? Simple — maximal compatibility, even Windows 11 can run Bash scripts with installation of some optional extra packages!

You may have heard that recent versions of macOS use Zsh as their default shell, does that not mean that Bash is going away on the Mac? Nope! There's a big difference between an OSes default shell, the one used to power intreractive terminal windows, and the set of shells the OS provides for scripting. Not only do the very latest versions of macOS support Bash scripts, they still support `sh` scripts!

### Script Structure

As we've already mentioned, the first line of a shell script must be a shebang line that specifies the shell to execute the script with. Each subsequent line is treated as a separate command, though blank lines are ignored.

Comments can be added by using the octothorp character at the start of a line, or at the start of a word to ignore the remainder of a line, e.g.:

```sh
# a full-line bash comment
echo 'hello world' # an end-of-line bash comment
```

By default each line is treated as a separte command, so long commands need to go onto long single lines. You can avoid this by using a back-slash (`\`) as the last character on the line, this effectively escapes the end of line character.

```sh
echo 'first argument to echo' \
  'second argument to the echo command started above'
```

### A Portable Shebang Line

The first line of any shell script specifies the shell to use to execute the script. For reasons that are still very much debated, this first line is known as [the shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)). The simplest form of shebang line is an octothorp (`#`) followed by an exclamation, followed by the full path to the shell. If Bash was reliably stored in the same location on every OS, we could use a shebang like the one below relaibly:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

Unfortunately, different OSes and even different Linux distros store Bash in different places, so we need to add a little indirection into our shebang line to account for that.

Thankfully, the standard [`env` terminal command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env) can be used to find bash on the system and then execute it, so that's what we'll be doing. Our shebang line will be:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

### Our First Shell Script

As is traditional, we'll start our shell script journey with a script to print the phrase *Hello World*. You'll find this file in the instalment resources as `helloWorld.sh`, or you can create a new file of your own with the following  content:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo 'Hello World!'
```

The first line is our shebang line, and the only other line is the command to print the phrase, so in Bash, the print command is `echo`.

Before we can run our script we need to make it executable with the command:

```sh
chmod +x helloWorld.sh
```

Then, you can execute it with:

```sh
./helloWorld.sh
```

## Shell Variables

You'll find more details in Taming the Terminal XXX, but the basics of shell variables is that their default scope is the script they are defined in, they're created by assigning them a value with the `=` operator, and they're accessed by pre-fixing their name with the `$` operator.

The most important thing to remember is that **variable definitions must be _cuddled_**, that is to say, there cannot be a space on either side of the `=` symbol.

Note that an interactive terminal, i.e. a terminal window, behaves like a shell script you're writing in real time, so you can experiment with variables without the need to write scripts.

As an initial example, we can create a variable named `desert` with the value *waffles* with the following command:

```sh
desert=waffles
```

We can then use this variable in shell commands by pre-fixing it with a `$` symbol, e.g.:

```sh
# print the value of the desert variable
echo $desert

# use the wc command to count the letters
echo -n $desert | wc -c
```

Note the use of command pipelining to use the output as the `echo` command as the input to the `wc` command. You can learn all about *plumbing* in the terminal (as I call it) in instalments XXX YYY ZZZ of Taming the Terminal. Also note the use of the `-n` flag to tell `echo` not to add a trailing new line character to its output (leave it off and the count will be out by one).
