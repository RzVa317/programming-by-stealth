# PBS 105 of X — Seeing the Past with Git

The problem we're trying to solve throughout this entire mini-series is capturing a complete history of our creative projects. So far we've learned how to save points-in-time as *commits*, but what good is saving a snapshot if we can't look at it?

So far the closest we've come to looking into the past is using the `git diff` command to see the differences in a given file between the working copy and the staged version, or, the working copy and the previously committed version. What we haven't done yet it look back further into the past.

We'll start this instalment by picking up where we left off, using `git diff`, but this time we'll travel further back in time than simply the staging area or the previous commit.

Looking at changes is very useful, but sometimes you want to see everything as it was at a given time, so we'll also learn how to export an entire past version as a stand-alone archive.

Finally, we'll learn how to transport our entire working copy back in time, and why that might be a dangerous thing to do!

## Instalment Resources

TO DO — actually create the ZIP!

* The instalment ZIP file — [pbs105.zip](https://github.com/bartificer/programming-by-stealth/raw/master/instalmentZips/pbs105.zip).

## Playing Along

If you're like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change into the folder you extracted the ZIP into. You'll find a file in there named `pbs105a.bundle`, this is a bundled version of the repository we created in the previous instalment. It's a single file that contains all our commits from last time. To pick up where we left off, we need to make a new repository and import all the commits from the bundle. We'll name our new repository `pbs105a`. To create this new repo we'll take the following steps:

1. create a folder named `pbs105a`
2. change into that folder
3. initialise it as a Git repo
4. if needed, change the default branch from `master` to `main`
5. import all the commits from the bundle into our new repository

The commands to do all this are

```
mkdir pbs105a
cd pbs105a
git init
[ `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` = 'master' ] && git checkout -b main
git pull ../pbs105a.bundle
```

We can now verify that we have imported our full history of commits by with `git log`:

## Git Diff

We've already used `git diff` in a previous instalment, but let's refresh our memories of what we already know about the command before we learn anything new.

### A Quick Referesher

As it stands, our sample project contains an HTML page and a README file, and both contain references to PBS 104, we should update those to PBS 105. Additionally, there is a silly typo in the HTML file — I accidentally put a Markdown link into an HTML document by mistake!

Let's fix both, and let's use this as an opportunity to refersh our memories from last week and commit both sets of changes as separate commits. You'll find updated versions of both `README.md` and `index.html` in the folder `pbs105a-v2` in the instalment ZIP. Copy those two files over the ones in the repository.

Firstly, we can now use `git diff` with no arguments to see all changes in all files (since I don't want a pager, I'm using Git's `--no-pager` option):

```
bart-imac2018:pbs105a bart% git --no-pager diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 6fc5cdc..de6776c 100644
--- a/README.md

```

You can see there is just one change in `README.md`, and there are two changes in `index.html`.

Let's start by staging just the typo fix, as we learned in the previous instalment, we do that by staging the change with `git add` and the `--patch` flag`:

```
git add --patch index.html
```

We'll first be offered all the changes to the file as a single hunk, we want to get more granular, so type `s` then enter to *split* the hunk. We're now offered a hunk representing the change in instalment number, that's not the change we want to stage ATM, so hit `n` and enter to decline it. Now we're offered the typo fix, so hit `y` and enter to stage it.

Remember that we can see the changes to just a single file by adding that file as the argument to `git diff`. We can now see the remaining difference between our working copy and the staged version with `git diff`:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs105a bart% git diff index.html
diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
index 3c0417f..9bf599c 100644

And, we can see the difference between the staged copy and the previous commit by adding the `--cached` flag:

```

```

These are all the uses of `git diff` we've seen so far.

Before we move on to explore the command further, let's commit our changes.

First, the typo fix we've already staged:

```
git commit -m 'Fixed Markdown link in HTML file'
```

Now, let's stage and commit the instalment number increments:

```
git add README.md index.html
git commit -m "Updated PBS instalment number to 105 in all files"
```
