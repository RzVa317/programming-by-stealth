# PBS 127 of X â€” Introducing NPM (and Node)

We're  going to start the second phase of this series by expanding our developer's toolbox. Our developer's toolbox is basically code to help us write code!

We could install all our developer tools globally on our systems, but that comes with some notable drawbacks:

1. You need admin access to a computer to install things system-wide
2. You can only have one vesion of a tool when you install it system-wide, but different projects might need different versions
3. If a tool gets a major update that requires some kind of tweak or change within your projects, you'll have to do them all at once.

So, it's much better to install developer tools locally, within a project. Each project gets its own copy of the tools at what ever version it wants, and no admin access is needed.

Manually managing local coppies of tools in each project would be a chore, but thankfully, we can use a tool to help us manage the rest of our tools!

For the first two milestones for Phase 2 our developer tools will all be JavaScript-based, so the ideal tool to manage them is a JavaScript package manager, and the obvious choice there is the *Node Package Manager*, or NPM.
