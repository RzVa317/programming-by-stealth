# PBS 127 of X — Introducing NPM (and Node)

We're  going to start the second phase of this series by expanding our developer's toolbox. Our developer's toolbox is basically code to help us write code!

We could install all our developer tools globally on our systems, but that comes with some notable drawbacks:

1. You need admin access to a computer to install things system-wide
2. You can only have one vesion of a tool when you install it system-wide, but different projects might need different versions
3. If a tool gets a major update that requires some kind of tweak or change within your projects, you'll have to do them all at once.

So, it's much better to install developer tools locally, within a project. Each project gets its own copy of the tools at what ever version it wants, and no admin access is needed.

Manually managing local coppies of tools in each project would be a chore, but thankfully, we can use a tool to help us manage the rest of our tools!

For the first two milestones for Phase 2 our developer tools will all be JavaScript-based, so the ideal tool to manage them is a JavaScript package manager, and the obvious choice there is the *Node Package Manager*, or NPM.

## What are Node & NPM?

### The NodeJS JavaScript Runtime

As you might infer from the name, the Node Package Manager is part of the Node JavaScript runtime, better known as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). So far in this series we have run all of our JavaScript in the browser. The browser provides both the core JavaScript language, and the DOM, and, it comes with a very severe restriction — the browser confines JavaScript code inside a very restrictive sandbox. NodeJS is an entirely different environment for executing JavaScript. Like the browser NodeJS can execute core JavaScript, but there is no DOM in NodeJS, instead,  NodeJS provides its own set of APIs, and unlike the browser, NodeJS does not sandbox your JavaScript code. This means that code running in NodeJS is free to read and write files, to interact with processes, to receive incoming network connections, and even to create windows and run custom GUI code within them.

With NodeJS, JavaScript code can be used to write command line apps, to act as the back-end for a web server, or indeed to implement a server for any networked protocol, and even to power GUI apps. In short, NodeJS allow JavaScript to break free from the confines of the browser, and do pretty much anything!

NodeJS is free, open source, and cross-platform, so everyone can play along. While NodeJS is not a browser, it is very closely related to one very specific browser — Google's open source [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)). When Google set out to develop their own browser they needed to create a JavaScript runtime for the browser so it could support JavaScript. At the time one of the bottlenecks on then-modern websites was slow JavaScript execution. Google could have taken an existing open source JavaScript engine like [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey), the JavaScript engine that powers Firefox, but they chose not to. Instead, Google wanted to start fresh so their JavaScript engine would be fast and efficient without the decade or so of technical debt SpiderMonkey had accumulated. They succeeded in developing a lightning-fast JavaScript engine, and they named it for one of the most iconic engines in the world — [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)).

While Google developed V8 for their browser, because it's open source, it's found quite a few other homes since it was released in 2008, including NodeJS.

### The Node Package Manager (NPM)

If all NodeJS did was run JavaScript outside the browser it would already be a darn useful tool, but it does a lot more than that — it elegantly solves the problem of sharing and reusing code without ending up in dependency hell. Before NodeJS JavaScript as a language was missing a critical feature — the ability to easily bundle code into self-contained sharable and reusable chunks. Or, to use the correct jargon — JavaScript didn't provide support for packages. The developers of NodeJS solved this problem very elegantly, having learned both what works and what doesn't from earlier packaging systems like Perl's *Comprehensive Perl Archive Network*, or [CPAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN). The end result is the *Node Package Manager*, or [NPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)).

When you install NodeJS you get two commands — `node` which gives you a JavaScript shell, and `npm` for managing JavaScript packages.
