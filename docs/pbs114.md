# PBS 114 of X — The Push & Pull of Git

Armed with our introduction to the concept of Git Remotes from [instalment 112], we created our first remote repository in [the previous instalment](pbs113), and used it to back up our work. We learned how to establish as relationship at the repository level, but not at the branch level. This made it much harder than it needs to be to keep our backup in sync.  To improve our workflow we need to learn how to make connections between local and remote branches.

In the previous instalment we implemented a simple scenario — a lone developer with one development computer, and a desire to back their work up to a NAS drive mounted on their computer's file system. Armed with our new-found ability to create connections between local and remote branches we' are now read'll be ready to expand our scenario to incorporate a second development computer, perhaps an imaginary laptop. What was our backup repository on the imagined NAS now becomes the authoritative or primary copy of the repo, and we get two working copies, one on our imagined desktop, and one on our imagined laptop. The NAS repo now takes on two roles — it remains a backup, but it now also acts as an intermediary between the laptop and desktop repos, allowing work to be distributed across both.

## Playing Along

If you'd like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change to the folder into which you extracted the ZIP . You'll find a bash script named `pbs114-init.sh` as well as a bundle file name `pbs114a.bundle`.

This script automates the steps bring us back to where we left off last time, one working repository now named `pbs114a-desktop`, and one pretend-NAS-repository now named `pbs114a-nas`. If you open the script in your favourite text editor you'll see that it does the following:

1. create a folder named `pbs114a-desktop`
2. change into that folder
3. initialise it as a Git repo
4. if needed, change the default branch from `master` to `main`
5. import all branches and tags from the bundle
6. change back to the zip folder
7. created a folder named `pbs114a-nas.git`
8. initialise `pbs114a-nas.git` as a bare Git repo
9. change into the `pbs114a-desktop` folder/repo
10. add `pbs114a-nas.git` as a remote named `origin`
11. fetch `origin` (the prentend-NAS repo)
11. push all branches to `origin`
12. push all tags to `origin`

One you have a terminal open in the folder the ZIP extracted to you're ready to run the script. We'll start by making sure the script is executable:

```
chmod 755 *.sh
```

Now we can execute it with:

```
./pbs114-init.sh
```

If you view the contents of the folder (in your file manager or on the Terminal with the `ls` command) you'll see that two new folders have been created named `pbs114a-desktop`, and `pbs114a-nas`, these are our repositories.

### A Little House-Keeping — Deleting an Obsolete Fetched Branch from a non-Existant Remote

When we imported *everything* from the bundle file, we actually imported a little more than we had intended to.

The bundle was created from the repository as it stood at the end of the previous instalment. At that time there was a remote named `backup` which had a branch named `main`, and we'd fetched that remote, so the repository contained a cache of that remote branch.

Remotes don't restore from bundles, and, our init script did not create a new remote named `backup`, instead, it created a remote named `origin`. We can see that our *desktop* repository has exactly one remote named `origin` by changing into that repository (`cd  pbs114a-desktop`) and listing all remotes (`git remote`):

```
bart-imac2018:pbs114 bart% cd pbs114a-desktop   
bart-imac2018:pbs114a-desktop bart% git remote
origin
bart-imac2018:pbs114a-desktop bart%
```

However, if we list all cached remote branches (with `git branch -r`) we find more than we were expecting:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs114a-desktop bart% git branch -r
  backup/main
  origin/main
bart-imac2018:pbs114a-desktop bart%
```

Since there is no remote named `backup` any  more, this cached remote branch is useless, and should be removed. We can do this by combining the `-d` for *delete* & `-r` for *remote* flags with the `git branch` command:

```
git branch -dr backup/main
```

Listing all cached remote branches now shows what we expect, just one remote branch, `origin/main`:

```
bart-imac2018:pbs114a-desktop bart% git branch -r             
  origin/main
bart-imac2018:pbs114a-desktop bart%
```
