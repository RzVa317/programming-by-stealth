# PBS 133 of X — Firming up our Foundations

We're getting closer to having all our proverbial ducks in a row for starting work on the re-write of the `Crypt::HSXKPasswd` Perl module in JavaScript. Before we could start we needed to introduce some new technologies and make some technology decisions. Here's a quick status update:

1. Introduce ES6 modules — done ✅
2. Introduce Node & NPM — done ✅
3. Choose a Linter learn how to use it — ESLint (with thanks to guest teacher Helma van der Linded) ✅ 
4. Chose a documentation generator and learn how to use it — JSDoc with the DocDash theme ✅
5. Choose a Test Driven Development (TDD) platform and learn how to use it — work in progress (see below)
6. Choose a bundler and learn how to use it — to do

I spent my Christmas break working on the fifth point — figuring out the most appropriate TDD platform for the project. The contenders were QUnit, Mocha, Jasmin, and Jest.

I've picked Jest, but before we can start it there are some fundamental JavaScript concepts we need to refresh in our minds, and, explore a little more deeply. Simultaneously, the community over on Slack have highlighted a few additional concepts that some are finding a little difficult to digest. Given those two facts, it seems sensible to dedicate this episode to a collection of refreshers, specifically:

1. Some confusion around the difference between `npm install` and `npm ci`.
2. Some confusion around JSDoc tags.
3. A refresher on some of the more esoteric aspects of functions — anonymous functions, arrow functions, and immediately-executing functions.
4. An unusual use of getter functions that's becoming popular in some modern JavaScript APIs, including Jest.

## Final Thoughts

Hopefully the first two sections will help people better understand how we're using NPM, and how to document code effectively. The final two sections will help us better understand the Jest TDD API which we'll be introducing in the next instalment.
