# PBS Tibit 5 of Y â€” Tips for the Vacationing Programmer

If bashing away on some code on a beach-side Mediterranean terrance  with a pitcher of sangria in a warm August evening breeze is your idea of heaven, this special instalment is for you ðŸ™‚ Those of us who really love programming love to get deep into some purely personal coding projects while we're on our summer vacation, but if often fails to go to plan because of internet connectivity issues. If you want your vacation coding projects to go well, you absolutely need to do some prep work before you board that plane or start up that old camper van!

Every situation will be different, but you'll fall somewhere on two spectra â€” from the same hardware you normall use to totally different hardware, and from the same level of connectivity to none at all.

TO DO

## Before You Go

### Patchy Patchy Patch Patch ðŸ˜‰

Even if you're expecting to have relatively fast internet access, it makes sense to get all your software patched from the comfort of your own home before you set off. I stronly advise patching the OS, updating any app store apps, and opening the other apps you use to let them check for updates and do their little re-start dance.

### Clone the Repo(s)

Again, from the comfort of your own home, clone all the repos you think you might want to work on. That seems like an obvious thing to do, but I have some less ovious advice â€” also clone other repost that use similar technologies that you might want to take a peep at to remind yourself how something is done. Given modern hard drive sizes, code is negligable, so better to clone more than you need than to find yourself wishing you could just have a quick look at some function or other you remember having to spend a lot of time on.
