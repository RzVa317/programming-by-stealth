## Reminder — the Open Source Community is not a Team

Before we get stuck into the details, I want to re-iterate what makes the open source community different to a team of friends or co-workers. A team is a group of equals were everyone can push commits to, and pull commits from, a shared repository. The open source community is more complex. Within a project there will be a core group of people with read and write access, the so-called *maintainers*, but many more people will want to access the code, and some will want to contribute fixes or enhancements to the code. Opening up read-access to the world is no problem, bit write access? If you simply opened up your repository for anyone to push to you'd be hosting malware within minutes! Clearly, you need a better workflow!

## Three Open Source Scenarios

We're going to look at three levels of interaction you can choose to have with an open source project hosted on GitHub:

1. You can use the code exactly as-is
2. You can use the code with a few customisations of your own
3. You can customise the code and contribute those customisations back to the project

## Scenario 1 — Use Code As-is (Just Clone it)

## Scenario 2 — Use Customised Code (Fork & Pull)

## Scenario 3 — Contribute (Fork & Create Pull Requests)
