# PBS 140 of X — UML Class Diagrams

At this stage we have all the coding tools needed to port the Crypt::HSXKPasswd Perl module to JavaScript figured out — we know we'll be building the library in the NodeJS environment, using JSDoc to document it, using Jest to test it, and using WebPack to package it for publication.

Before we can start writing actual code we need to capture the design we'll be implementing in a standard way. We'll be producing API documentation with JSDoc as an output, so we obviously can't use that as our guide when building the first version of the code. We need to capture the requirements for version 1.0 in a way that's clear, and useful to developers. The documentation for the current Perl implementation will be helpful, but Perl and JavaScript are quite different languages, so the first step will be to translate the API from a collection of Perl modules into a collection of class definitions that can then be implemented in JavaScript.

It would certainly be possible to capture those class definitions in English, but that would be a horrendous chore in the first place, and finding what you need when you need it in a sea of text is painful, so it would make witting the code needlessly frustrating too — we need a better representation for the design. We need a diagram, but not just any diagram, we need a diagram created using an industry standard. In other words, we need a UML class diagram!
