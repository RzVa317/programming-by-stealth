## Playing Along — TO UPDATE

If you'd like to play along with the examples you'll need to download this instalment's ZIP file and unzip it. Open a terminal and change to the folder into which you extracted the ZIP . You'll find a bash script named `pbs115-init.sh` as well as a bundle file name `pbs115a.bundle`.

This script automates the steps bring us back to where we left off last time, two working repositories now named `pbs115a-desktop` & `pbs115a-laptop`, and one pretend-NAS-repository now named `pbs115a-nas.git`. If you open the script in your favourite text editor you'll see that it does the following:

1. clone the bundle into a new bare repository named `pbs115a-nas.git`
2. clone the new NAS repository into a regular new repository named `pbs115a-desktop`
3. clone the NAS repository again into a regular new repository named `pbs115a-laptop`

One you have a terminal open in the folder the ZIP extracted to you're ready to run the script. We'll start by making sure the script is executable:

```
chmod 755 *.sh
```

Now we can execute it with:

```
./pbs115-init.sh
```

If you view the contents of the folder (in your file manager or on the Terminal with the `ls` command) you'll see that three new folders have been created named `pbs114a-nas.git`, `pbs115a-desktop`, and `pbs114a-laptop`, these are our repositories.
