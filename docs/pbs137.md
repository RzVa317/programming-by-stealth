# PBS 137 of X — Bundling a Library with WebPack

Since starting *phase 2* of this series we've been building out the developer toolkit we'll need to deliver a JavaScript version of the `Crypt::HSXKPasswd` Perl module, and we've been making excellent progress:

1. Introduce ES6 modules — done ✅
2. Introduce Node & NPM — done ✅
3. Choose a Linter and learn how to use it — ESLint (with thanks to guest teacher Helma van der Linden) ✅ 
4. Chose a documentation generator and learn how to use it — JSDoc with the DocDash theme ✅
5. Choose a Test Driven Development (TDD) platform and learn how to use it — Jest  ✅
6. Choose a bundler and learn how to use it — to do

It's time to complete the checklist — after a lot of procrastination, I've chosen to use the bundler that has by far the most comminity mind-share, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

Webpack is an extremely future-rich and powerful tool. It's so featrure rich and powerful that it's quite difficult for beginners to find the sub-set of that functionality that solves their specific problem best. It would take many many instalments to cover even all the commonly used features offered by Webpack, so we're not going to do that, instead, we're going to look at the slice of webpack that solves our immediate problem — bundling a collection of JavaScript modules and all their dependencies into a single `.js` file that browsers can import with a `&lt;script&gt;` tag.

Basically — we want to use webpack to make the new HSXKPasswd library as easy to import into a web page as jQuery is!

## Why do we need a Bundler?

When you use an open source library like jQuery or MomentJS in your code you import a single file, usually from a CDN, and it injects a variable into the global scope that you use to access the library, `$` in case of jQuery, and `moment` in the case of MomentJS. If you've ever opened one of those all-in-one files, you'll notice the code looks utterly cryptic and like no human could understand or maintain it. That's because it wasn't written by a human, it was built by a bundler based on some (hopefully) well organised human-readable code, probably broken  into lots of sub-modules and spread across muiltiple files. There's also a good chance the code the humans wrote imported 3rd-party code from elsewhere, and the bundler injected all that code into the one file too.

So, when it comes to bundling a library, the input is a folder full of your own JavaScript files which can in turn import 3rd-party modules, and the output is a single file that includes and encapsulates all your code and all the dependencies it imports. This single output file can be formated as an ES6 JavaScript module, or, using one of the pseudo-standards that preceeded the official standard like CommonJS. It can also output in so-called Univresal format, or UMD, which is compatible with all the common pseudo-standards, and is still the format with the broadest browser support, and hence, the format used by major open source libraries like jQuery and MomentJS.

### Why Encpsulate Dependencies

The encapsulation of dependencies is one of the most important concepts to understand. Up until this point, when our code has made use of a third party library like jQuery or MomentJS we have relied on those dependencies being loaded separately form our code with their own script tags pointing at an appropriate CDN to fetch the dependencies.

I've avoided the jargon until now, but what we have been doing is spedifying all our dependencies as *peer dependencies*. There are times when you want to do that, and bundlers like Webpack support that. When you specify a module as a peer dependencyin your Webpack config it will be excluded from the bundle. A real-world example of this is that because jQuery is so big, Bootstrap 4 chose to make jQuery a peer dependency, hence we always had to use two script tags to get Bootstrap 4's JavaScript functionality to work — jQuery from a CDN, then Bootstrap 4 from a CDN.

Most of the time though, we don't want to burden the users of our library like that — we want them to be able to add a single script tag into their HTML, and have the libarary we published just work. This is the experience we get with MomentJS.

**User convenience** is definitely a major reason to encapsulate dependencies, but there are other reasons too, including **reliability**, and **security**.

With peer dependencies your code is at the mercy of the user's ability to reliably import the correct versions of those dependencies. This makes your code unreliable in two ways — firstly, they can import a slightly different version to the one you tested on, opening up the possibility of difficult to reproduce bugs, and secondly, if they use a CDN, your code is now dependent on the reliability of a CDN you have no control over.

This brings us nicely to security — encapsualting dependencies gives you control over your library's security, but it also gives you **responsibility** for your library's security! There are two scenarios I want to highlight.

Firstly — if a vulnerablity is found and patched in a peer dependency your users all have to be sure they update their code to incude a non-vulnerable version. If you encapsulate the dependency you can simply update the version you bundle and publish an update to your library that's secure.

Secondly — if a dependency author goes rogue and sabbotages their library (as has happened repeatedly in the spring of 2022), your users won't get that bad update if you don't update your bundle. This is why maintainers of bundled projects have a responsibility to update their dependencies in a contorlled way, and not in an entirely automatic way. This caught quite a few open source project off-guard in the spring of 2022, because they had entirely automated processes that blindly accepted all dependency updates and built fresh bundles nightly or even hourly, hence they inadvertantly spread malware!

It's important to remember that we've look at just a tiny sub-set of what Webpack can do here — we've solved one very specific problem, and ignored everything else!

We will be re-visiting Webpack again later in the series, because we'll need to learn more about how it works so it can solve a completly different problem for us — deploying a JavaScript web app with a whole bunch of dependencies as a stand-alone app that somehow imbeds its dependencies in a managable way, removing our dependence on CDNs to deliver commonly used libraries like jQuery. Don't worry if that doesn't make sense to you yet, it should do once we get as far as developing the new web front-end for the JavaScript version of `Crypt::HSXKPasswd`.
