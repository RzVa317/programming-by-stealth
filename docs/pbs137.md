# PBS 137 of X — Bundling a Library with WebPack

Since starting *phase 2* of this series we've been building out the developer toolkit we'll need to deliver a JavaScript version of the `Crypt::HSXKPasswd` Perl module, and we've been making excellent progress:

1. Introduce ES6 modules — done ✅
2. Introduce Node & NPM — done ✅
3. Choose a Linter and learn how to use it — ESLint (with thanks to guest teacher Helma van der Linden) ✅ 
4. Chose a documentation generator and learn how to use it — JSDoc with the DocDash theme ✅
5. Choose a Test Driven Development (TDD) platform and learn how to use it — Jest  ✅
6. Choose a bundler and learn how to use it — to do

It's time to complete the checklist — after a lot of procrastination, I've chosen to use the bundler that has by far the most comminity mind-share, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

Webpack is an extremely future-rich and powerful tool. It's so featrure rich and powerful that it's quite difficult for beginners to find the sub-set of that functionality that solves their specific problem best. It would take many many instalments to cover even all the commonly used features offered by Webpack, so we're not going to do that, instead, we're going to look at the slice of webpack that solves our immediate problem — bundling a collection of JavaScript modules and all their dependencies into a single `.js` file that browsers can import with a `&lt;script&gt;` tag.

Basically — we want to use webpack to make the new HSXKPasswd library as easy to import into a web page as jQuery is!

## Why do we need a Bundler?

When you use an open source library like jQuery or MomentJS in your code you import a single file, usually from a CDN, and it injects a variable into the global scope that you use to access the library, `$` in case of jQuery, and `moment` in the case of MomentJS. If you've ever opened one of those all-in-one files, you'll notice the code looks utterly cryptic and like no human could understand or maintain it. That's because it wasn't written by a human, it was built by a bundler based on some (hopefully) well organised human-readable code, probably broken  into lots of sub-modules and spread across muiltiple files. There's also a good chance the code the humans wrote imported 3rd-party code from elsewhere, and the bundler injected all that code into the one file too.

So, when it comes to bundling a library, the input is a folder full of JavaScript files that import other 3rd-party modules, and the output is a single file that encapsulates the entire library and all its dependencies.

It's important to remember that we've look at just a tiny sub-set of what Webpack can do here — we've solved one very specific problem, and ignored everything else!

We will be re-visiting Webpack again later in the series, because we'll need to learn more about how it works so it can solve a completly different problem for us — deploying a JavaScript web app with a whole bunch of dependencies as a stand-alone app that somehow imbeds its dependencies in a managable way, removing our dependence on CDNs to deliver commonly used libraries like jQuery. Don't worry if that doesn't make sense to you yet, it should do once we get as far as developing the new web front-end for the JavaScript version of `Crypt::HSXKPasswd`.
